However, this is simply a misconception. The truth is that hair falls out at a consistent rate of 50 to 100 hairs per day, regardless of whether it's growing or not.</p><p>So, why do people think that their hair falls out more when it's growing? The reason is that when hair is growing, it pushes out the old, dead hair strands from the follicles. This shedding process is known as "telogen effluvium," and it can make it seem like more hair is falling out than usual.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to:</h2><p>If you're experiencing hair loss while your hair is growing, there are a few things you can do to manage it:</p><h3>1. Practice good hair care:</h3><p>Make sure you're using a gentle shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type. Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and curling irons too often, as they can damage your hair and cause breakage.</p><h3>2.

Make sure you're getting enough protein, iron, and biotin, as these nutrients are essential for healthy hair growth.</p><h3>3. Manage stress:</h3><p>Stress can have a negative impact on your hair health, so it's important to manage it effectively. Try practicing relaxation techniques like meditation or yoga, or consider seeing a therapist if your stress levels are high.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step:</h2><p>Here are some steps you can take to manage hair loss while your hair is growing:</p><h3>Step 1:</h3><p>Start by assessing your hair care routine. Are you using products that are too harsh for your hair? Are you using hot tools too often? If so, make some changes to your routine to help protect your hair.</p><h3>Step 2:</h3><p>Make sure you're eating a healthy diet that's rich in vitamins and minerals. Consider taking a daily multivitamin or supplement to ensure you're getting all the nutrients your hair needs.</p><h3>Step 3:</h3><p>Manage your stress levels by practicing relaxation techniques or seeing a therapist. This can help reduce the impact of stress on your hair health.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips:</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help manage hair loss while your hair is growing:</p><h3>1. Be gentle:</h3><p>Avoid pulling or tugging on your hair, and try to be gentle when brushing or combing it. This can help prevent breakage and hair loss.</p><h3>2. Get regular trims:</h3><p>Getting regular trims can help prevent split ends, which can lead to hair breakage and loss.</p><h3>3. Use a wide-tooth comb:</h3><p>Using a wide-tooth comb can help detangle your hair without causing breakage or damage.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ:</h2><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can have a negative impact on your hair health and contribute to hair loss.</p><h3>Q: Can hair products cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, using products that are too harsh for your hair can contribute to hair loss.
