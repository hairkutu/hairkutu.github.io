It marks the end of a woman's reproductive years and is typically diagnosed after a woman has gone 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period. Menopause can occur anywhere from a woman's late 40s to early 60s.</p><h3 id="how-does-menopause-affect-hair">How Does Menopause Affect Hair?</h3><p>As women go through menopause, their bodies go through a number of hormonal changes that can impact various aspects of their health, including their hair. The most common hair-related symptom of menopause is hair thinning or hair loss, which is often related to a decrease in estrogen levels.</p><p>Estrogen plays a critical role in maintaining healthy hair growth, as it helps to keep hair in the anagen (growth) phase for longer periods of time. As estrogen levels decline during menopause, hair may spend less time in the anagen phase and more time in the telogen (resting) phase, which can lead to hair thinning or hair loss.</p><h3 id="does-pubic-hair-thin-after-menopause">Does Pubic Hair Thin After Menopause?</h3><p>While menopause can certainly impact the hair on your head, there is little evidence to suggest that it has a significant impact on pubic hair.
