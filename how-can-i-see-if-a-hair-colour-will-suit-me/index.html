If you have a cool undertone, look for hair colours with ash or cool undertones. If you have a warm undertone, look for hair colours with golden or warm undertones. If you have a neutral undertone, you can choose pretty much any hair colour.</p><h4>Can I dye my hair if I have sensitive skin?</h4><p>If you have sensitive skin, it's important to choose a hair dye that's free of harsh chemicals and irritants. Look for hair dyes that are labeled "sensitive" or "gentle" and always do a patch test before dyeing your hair.</p><h4>How often should I touch up my roots?</h4><p>The frequency of root touch-ups depends on the colour of your hair and how fast it grows. For natural hair colours, touch-ups are usually needed every 4-6 weeks.
