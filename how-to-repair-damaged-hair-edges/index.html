Here are some techniques and products that can help:</p><h3>1. Moisturize Your Hair and Scalp</h3><p>Dry, brittle hair is more prone to breakage, so it's important to keep your hair and scalp moisturized.

You can also try applying a moisturizing mask or deep conditioner to your hair and scalp once a week.</p><h3>2. Massage Your Scalp</h3><p>Massaging your scalp can help stimulate blood flow and promote hair growth. Use your fingers to gently massage your hairline in circular motions for a few minutes each day.</p><h3>3. Use a Hair Growth Serum</h3><p>There are many hair growth serums and oils on the market that claim to promote healthy hair growth. Look for products that contain ingredients like biotin, castor oil, and peppermint oil.</p><h3>4. Protect Your Hairline</h3><p>To prevent further damage to your hair edges, try to avoid tight hairstyles that pull on your hairline. You can also protect your hairline by sleeping on a satin pillowcase or using a satin hair bonnet at night.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to repairing your damaged hair edges:</p><h3>Step 1: Identify the Cause</h3><p>Figure out what's causing your hair edges to become damaged.
