The good news is that yes, you can start locs with long hair! In this article, we will go over how to start locs with long hair, step-by-step instructions, tips, frequently asked questions and hair care advice to help you on your journey to beautiful, healthy locs.</p><h2>How to Start Locs with Long Hair</h2><p>Starting locs with long hair requires some preparation and patience. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Decide on the Size of Your Locs</h3><p>The first step in starting your locs is to decide on the size you want them to be. This will determine the amount of time it will take for your locs to fully mature. Keep in mind that the larger the loc, the quicker it will mature. Smaller locs will take longer to mature, but they will give you a more defined look.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start, make sure your hair is clean and free of any product buildup. It is important to start with clean hair to prevent any issues later on.</p><h3>Step 3: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Next, you need to section your hair. You can do this by parting your hair with a comb or your fingers. The size of the section will depend on the size of the loc you want. Make sure the sections are even and consistent throughout your head.</p><h3>Step 4: Begin Twisting</h3><p>Starting from the root, twist the section of hair in a clockwise direction. Continue twisting until you reach the end of the section. You can use a small amount of locking gel or beeswax to help hold the twist in place.</p><h3>Step 5: Repeat the Process</h3><p>Repeat the twisting process on each section of hair until your entire head is twisted. Make sure each twist is consistent in size and shape.</p><h3>Step 6: Maintenance</h3><p>Once your locs are started, you will need to maintain them by keeping them clean and moisturized. You can do this by washing your hair regularly and applying oil or moisturizer to your scalp and locs.</p><h2>Tips for Starting Locs with Long Hair</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you start your locs with long hair:</p><ul><li>Be patient. It takes time for locs to fully mature, so be prepared for the journey.</li><li>Use a natural shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and prevent buildup.</li><li>Use a satin or silk scarf or pillowcase to prevent your locs from drying out.</li><li>Avoid using heavy products or oils on your locs, as this can cause buildup and prevent them from maturing properly.</li><li>Be gentle with your locs when styling, as they can be fragile in the beginning stages.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About Starting Locs with Long Hair</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about starting locs with long hair:</p><h3>Can I start locs with relaxed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can start locs with relaxed hair. However, keep in mind that the process may take longer and your locs may not be as strong as they would be with natural hair.</p><h3>How long does it take for locs to fully mature?</h3><p>It can take anywhere from 6 months to 2 years for locs to fully mature. The time it takes will depend on the size of your locs and how well you maintain them.</p><h3>Can I wash my hair while starting locs?</h3><p>Yes, you can and should wash your hair regularly while starting locs. Use a natural shampoo and conditioner and avoid using heavy products or oils.</p><h2>Hair Care for Locs with Long Hair</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips to keep your locs healthy and beautiful:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a natural shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Moisturize your scalp and locs with oil or moisturizer to prevent dryness.</li><li>Avoid using heavy products or oils on your locs, as this can cause buildup and prevent them from maturing properly.</li><li>Protect your locs at night by wearing a satin or silk scarf or bonnet.</li><li>Be gentle when styling your locs to prevent breakage.</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Starting locs with long hair is possible and can lead to beautiful, healthy locs.
