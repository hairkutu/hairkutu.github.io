Do you want to switch up your hairstyle without cutting it? Training your hair to go in a different direction is possible and doesn't require any drastic measures. In this article, we'll go through the steps, tips, and hair care necessary to train your hair to go in a different direction.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Training your hair to go in a different direction means conditioning your hair to lay in a specific direction.

The time it takes depends on the texture and thickness of your hair.</p><h3>Can I train my hair to go in multiple directions?</h3><p>Yes, you can train your hair to go in multiple directions.
