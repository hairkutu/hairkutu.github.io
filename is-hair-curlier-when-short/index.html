If you're someone who's always wondered whether your hair becomes curlier when you cut it short, then you're in the right place. In this post, we'll take a closer look at whether this is true and what you can do to embrace your natural curls.

Is hair curlier when short? The answer is not a simple one. Hair can appear curlier when it's short, but that doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually curlier. When hair is long, the weight of the hair can pull curls down, making them appear looser. When hair is short, there's less weight pulling the curls down, making them look bouncier and more defined. So, while your hair may look curlier when it's short, it's not necessarily true that it's curlier.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>If you want to embrace your natural curls, there are a few things you can do. First, make sure you're using the right products. Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair, such as sulfate-free shampoos and conditioners. These products will help keep your curls hydrated and defined.</p><p>Next, consider getting a haircut that's tailored to your curls.
