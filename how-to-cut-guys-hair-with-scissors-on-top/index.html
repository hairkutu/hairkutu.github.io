Cutting hair with scissors on top is a classic and timeless technique that can give a clean and polished look. In this article, we'll guide you through the steps of how to cut guys hair with scissors on top, so you can achieve a professional-looking cut right from the comfort of your own home.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The technique of cutting guys hair with scissors on top involves trimming the hair on the top of the head while leaving the sides and back longer. This style is versatile and can be customized to suit different hair types and face shapes. By following the right steps and using the correct tools, you can give a smart and stylish haircut to your male friends and family.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to cut guys hair with scissors on top:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather the necessary tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have the right tools on hand. You'll need a pair of sharp hairdressing scissors, a comb, hair clips, and a spray bottle filled with water. It's important to use sharp scissors to ensure a clean and precise cut.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and dry the hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying the hair. This will make it easier to cut and ensure that the hair is clean and free of any product buildup. Use the spray bottle to dampen the hair slightly before cutting.</p><h3>Step 3: Section the hair</h3><p>Using the comb, divide the hair into sections. Clip the sides and back away from the top section, which is the area you'll be cutting. This will help you to work more efficiently and ensure that you don't accidentally cut too much hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the hair on top</h3><p>Start by cutting the hair on top, using the comb to lift the hair and the scissors to trim off the desired length. Work from the front to the back, cutting small sections at a time. You can use your fingers to gauge the length and ensure that the hair is even.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the sides and back</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the hair on top, unclip the sides and back and use the scissors to blend the hair. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at an angle, moving from the longer hair to the shorter hair to create a gradual transition. Be careful not to cut too much hair, as this can create an uneven look.</p><h3>Step 6: Check for any unevenness</h3><p>After you've finished cutting, check for any unevenness or stray hairs. Use the scissors to trim any areas that need touching up.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting guys hair with scissors on top:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer length and gradually work your way down, as it's easier to cut more hair than to add it back.</li><li>Use a mirror to check your progress and ensure that the hair is even from all angles.</li><li>Be patient and take your time, as rushing can lead to mistakes.</li><li>Practice makes perfect, so don't be discouraged if your first attempt isn't perfect.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting guys hair with scissors on top:</p><h3>Can I use regular scissors to cut hair?</h3><p>No, it's important to use hairdressing scissors, as they are specifically designed for cutting hair and provide a clean and precise cut.</p><h3>What length should I cut the hair on top?</h3><p>This depends on personal preference and the desired style. It's best to start with a longer length and gradually work your way down until you achieve the desired look.</p><h3>How often should I cut my hair?</h3><p>This depends on the rate of hair growth and the desired length. As a general rule, it's recommended to get a haircut every 4-6 weeks to maintain a neat and polished look.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair looking and feeling healthy after a haircut, it's important to follow a good hair care routine. This includes regular washing and conditioning, using a heat protectant when styling with hot tools, and avoiding harsh chemicals and excessive heat styling.</p><p>Now that you know how to cut guys hair with scissors on top, you can give stylish haircuts to the men in your life with confidence. With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a professional-looking cut right from the comfort of your own home.</p></article>
