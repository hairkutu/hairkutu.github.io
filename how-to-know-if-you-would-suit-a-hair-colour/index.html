With so many options out there, it's hard to know where to start. In this article, we'll give you tips on how to determine which hair colour will look best on you. </p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in determining which hair colour will suit you is to consider your skin tone. Skin tone is the most important factor in determining which hair colour will look best on you. There are three main categories of skin tone: cool, warm and neutral.</p><p>If you have cool-toned skin, you will look best with hair colours that have cool undertones, such as ash blonde, platinum blonde, and cool brown. If you have warm-toned skin, you will look best with hair colours that have warm undertones, such as golden blonde, caramel brown, and copper. If you have neutral-toned skin, you can pull off both cool and warm-toned hair colours.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Here are some steps you can take to determine your skin tone:</p><ol><li>Look at the veins on the underside of your wrist. If they appear blue, you have cool-toned skin. If they appear green, you have warm-toned skin.</li><li>Examine the jewellery you wear. If you look best in silver jewellery, you have cool-toned skin. If you look best in gold jewellery, you have warm-toned skin.</li><li>Consider your natural hair and eye colour. If you have blue or green eyes and blonde or light brown hair, you likely have cool-toned skin. If you have brown or hazel eyes and dark hair, you likely have warm-toned skin.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>When choosing a new hair colour, consider your lifestyle and how much maintenance you're willing to do. If you're low maintenance, opt for a hair colour that won't require frequent touch-ups. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, go for a hair colour that requires more upkeep.</p><p>It's also a good idea to consult with a professional stylist before making any drastic changes to your hair. They can give you advice on which hair colours will suit you best and can help you achieve the look you want.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>What hair colours look best on cool-toned skin?</h3><p>Hair colours that have cool undertones, such as ash blonde, platinum blonde, and cool brown, look best on cool-toned skin.</p><h3>What hair colours look best on warm-toned skin?</h3><p>Hair colours that have warm undertones, such as golden blonde, caramel brown, and copper, look best on warm-toned skin.</p><h3>Can I pull off both cool and warm-toned hair colours if I have neutral-toned skin?</h3><p>Yes, if you have neutral-toned skin, you can pull off both cool and warm-toned hair colours.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Once you've chosen a new hair colour, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking its best. Use a shampoo and conditioner that are specifically formulated for colour-treated hair to help maintain the vibrancy of your new colour. It's also a good idea to use a hair mask once a week to keep your hair moisturized and healthy.</p><p>In conclusion, choosing a new hair colour can be a fun and exciting experience.
