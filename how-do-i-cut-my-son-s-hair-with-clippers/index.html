Start by washing and drying his hair. Then, use a comb to remove any tangles or knots. If your son has long hair, tie it up with a clip or hair tie.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the Right Guard Size</h3><p>Clippers come with different guard sizes, which determine the length of the hair. Choose the right guard size depending on the length of hair you want your son to have. For example, if you want a shorter cut, use a smaller guard size.</p><h3>Step 3: Start with the Sides</h3><p>Start cutting your son's hair from the sides. Use a longer guard size for the top and a shorter guard size for the sides. Use the clippers to cut the hair from the bottom to the top in an upward motion. Repeat this process until you have gone around the entire head.</p><h3>Step 4: Move to the Top</h3><p>Once you have finished the sides, move to the top of your son's head. Use a longer guard size to achieve the desired length. Cut the hair in small sections, moving from the front to the back of the head. Use the clippers to cut the hair in an upward motion.</p><h3>Step 5: Blend the Hair</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the top and sides of your son's hair, it's time to blend the hair. Use scissors to blend the hair on the sides and the top. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it with scissors to create a smooth transition between the different lengths.</p><h3>Step 6: Clean Up the Neckline</h3><p>Use the clippers to clean up the neckline. Use a shorter guard size to create a clean line around the neck. Make sure the line is straight and even.</p><h3>Step 7: Clean Up the Ears</h3><p>Use the clippers to clean up the hair around the ears. Use a shorter guard size to create a clean line around the ears. Make sure the line is straight and even.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Your Son's Hair with Clippers</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect haircut for your son:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down to a shorter guard size.</li><li>Use scissors to blend the hair for a more natural look.</li><li>Take breaks if your son is getting restless or uncomfortable.</li><li>Use a cape or towel to prevent hair from getting on your son's clothes.</li><li>Use a spray bottle filled with water to dampen the hair and make it easier to cut.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>How often should I cut my son's hair?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your son's hair grows.
