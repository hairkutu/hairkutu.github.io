This style adds some height to your hair and gives it some movement. You can also add some volume to your hair by using a diffuser when blow-drying your hair.</p><h3>Long Curly Hair</h3><p>If you prefer long hair, you can go for a layered cut or a shaggy cut. These styles add some texture to your hair and give it a bohemian vibe.
