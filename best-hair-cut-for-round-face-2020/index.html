In 2020, there were plenty of stylish options to choose from. From short and edgy to long and layered, there is a cut that will work for everyone. Keep reading to learn about the best hair cuts for round faces in 2020.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A round face has soft, curved lines and a width that is roughly the same as its length. The goal of a hair cut for a round face is to create the illusion of length and angles. This can be achieved through a variety of techniques, such as adding layers, creating volume at the crown, and embracing asymmetry.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>The first step in choosing a hair cut for a round face is to determine your face shape. Take a close look at your face in the mirror and measure the width and length. If they are roughly the same, you have a round face.</p><p>Next, consider your hair texture and lifestyle. Do you have thick or thin hair? Do you prefer low-maintenance styles or are you willing to put in the effort to maintain a more high-maintenance cut?</p><p>Once you have a good understanding of your face shape, hair texture, and lifestyle, you can start exploring different hair cuts that will flatter your features. Here are some of the best options for round faces in 2020:</p><h3>Short and Edgy</h3><p>A short, edgy cut can help to elongate a round face and create the illusion of angles.

A side-swept fringe can also help to add angles to a round face. Avoid blunt cuts and center parts, as they can make a round face look wider.</p><h3>Asymmetrical</h3><p>An asymmetrical cut can help to break up the symmetry of a round face and create a more angular look. Consider a bob with one side longer than the other, or a pixie cut with an angled fringe.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Once you have chosen a hair cut that you like, itâs important to communicate your vision to your stylist. Bring in pictures or reference images to ensure that you are both on the same page.</p><p>During the haircut, your stylist will use a variety of techniques to create the desired shape. They may use scissors or a razor to add texture and movement, or they may use a razor to create sharp angles.</p><p>After the cut is complete, your stylist may use styling products to add volume or texture. They may also use hot tools like a curling iron or straightener to create a specific look.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when choosing a hair cut for a round face:</p><ul><li>Avoid blunt cuts and center parts, as they can make a round face look wider.</li><li>Add layers or texture to create movement and volume.</li><li>Consider an asymmetrical cut to create angles.</li><li>Avoid styles that are too long or too short, as they can accentuate roundness.</li><li>Consult with your stylist to find a cut that works with your lifestyle and hair texture.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the best hair cut for a round face?</h3><p>The best hair cut for a round face is one that creates the illusion of length and angles.
