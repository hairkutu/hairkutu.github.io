Look no further than the “long on top, short on sides” haircut for men. This versatile haircut has been gaining popularity in recent years and for good reason – it looks great on almost any face shape and hair type. In this article, we will give you step-by-step instructions on how to achieve this look, share some tips, and answer some frequently asked questions. </p><h2> How to Get the Look </h2><p>The long on top, short on sides haircut is versatile and can be customized to suit your personal style. Here are the basic steps to get the look:</p><h3> Step 1: Choose Your Length </h3><p>The first step is to decide how long you want the hair on top to be. This will depend on your personal preference and the shape of your face. A good rule of thumb is to have the hair on top at least 3 inches long, but you can go longer if you like.</p><h3> Step 2: Choose Your Fade </h3><p>The next step is to choose the type of fade you want for the sides. The most popular fades are the high fade, mid fade, and low fade. The high fade starts at the temple and goes up to the hairline, the mid fade starts halfway up the head, and the low fade starts just above the ears. </p><h3> Step 3: Blend the Sides </h3><p>Once you have chosen your fade, it’s time to blend the sides with the top. Use clippers or scissors to gradually blend the hair on the sides with the longer hair on top. Make sure to blend the hair evenly to avoid any harsh lines.</p><h3> Step 4: Style Your Hair </h3><p>Finally, it’s time to style your hair. You can use a comb and some pomade to create a slicked-back look, or you can use your fingers and some texturizing spray to create a messy, tousled look. </p><h2> Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle </h2><p>Now that you have your long on top, short on sides haircut, you’ll want to keep it looking great. Here are some tips for maintaining your hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Visit your barber every four to six weeks to keep your haircut looking fresh and clean.</li><li>Use high-quality hair products that are suited to your hair type.</li><li>Wash your hair every two to three days to keep it healthy and clean.</li><li>Experiment with different styles to keep your look fresh and interesting.</li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about the long on top, short on sides haircut:</p><h3> What face shape is best for this hairstyle? </h3><p>Almost any face shape can pull off this hairstyle. However, it looks particularly good on those with oval or square-shaped faces.</p><h3> What hair type is best for this hairstyle? </h3><p>This hairstyle works best on those with thick, straight, or wavy hair. However, it can be adapted for those with finer or curly hair as well.</p><h3> Can I still have a part with this hairstyle? </h3><p>Yes, you can still have a part with this hairstyle. You can choose to have a side part or a middle part, depending on your personal preference.</p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p>When it comes to maintaining your long on top, short on sides hairstyle, it’s important to take care of your hair. Here are some tips for keeping your hair healthy:</p><ul><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner that are suited to your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like blow dryers and straighteners too often, as this can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a heat protectant spray before using hot tools.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to keep it healthy and free of split ends.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, the long on top, short on sides hairstyle is a versatile, trendy, and easy-to-maintain look for men. By following our step-by-step instructions, tips, and hair care advice, you can achieve this stylish look and keep it looking great for weeks to come. </p></article>
