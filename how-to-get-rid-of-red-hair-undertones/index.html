One of the most common is exposure to the sun, which can cause hair to lighten and take on a reddish hue. Another factor is genetics; if you have a family history of red hair, you may be more likely to have red undertones in your own hair.</p><p>Dyeing your hair can also contribute to red undertones. If you use a hair dye that contains red pigments, these pigments can linger even after the dye has faded.

Make sure you're using a permanent hair color, as semi-permanent or temporary dyes may not be strong enough to cover red undertones.</li><li>Leave the hair color on for the recommended amount of time.
