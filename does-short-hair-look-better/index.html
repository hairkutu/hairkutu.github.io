One of the most popular styles is the pixie cut. This style is short on the sides and back, with longer layers on top. This style can be worn straight, wavy, or curly. Another popular style is the bob, which is a short, straight cut that rests at the chin or just above it. This style can also be worn straight, wavy, or curly. The key to styling short hair is to use the right products and tools, such as a good quality hair dryer, flat iron, or curling iron. </p><h2>Step by Step:</h2><p>1.

Blow dry your hair using a hair dryer and a round brush. Use the brush to create volume and lift at the roots.</p><p>4. Once your hair is dry, use a flat iron or curling iron to create your desired style.</p><p>5. Finish with a hairspray or other styling product to hold your style in place.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Short Hair:</h2><p>1. Visit your stylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim to keep your haircut looking fresh.</p><p>2. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</p><p>3.
