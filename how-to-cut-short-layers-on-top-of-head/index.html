Follow these steps to section your hair:</p><ol><li>Divide your hair into four sections: two at the front and two at the back. Use a comb to create a center parting, and then make a horizontal parting from ear to ear.</li><li>Clip or tie the back sections out of the way.</li><li>Take one of the front sections and comb it forward over your face.

Follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Start with the front section that you combed forward. Hold it between your index and middle fingers, and point-cut the ends to create the desired length. Take small sections at a time to ensure evenness.</li><li>Move to the other front section and repeat the process.</li><li>Unclip or untie one of the back sections and comb it upward.

However, it's important to be careful and take your time. If you're not confident, it's best to seek the help of a professional hairdresser.</p><h3>How often should I cut my short layers?</h3><p>It depends on how fast your hair grows and how quickly your layers lose their shape. On average, you should cut your short layers every 6-8 weeks to maintain their style.</p><h3>Can I add color to my short layered hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can add color to your short layered hair. However, it's best to consult a professional hair colorist to ensure the best results.</p><h2 id="care">Hair Care</h2><p>After cutting your short layers, it's important to take care of your hair to maintain its health and style.
