This problem can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetics, hormonal imbalances, and environmental factors such as stress and poor nutrition. Understanding the root cause of your hair loss is key to finding an effective solution.</p><h2>How to:</h2><p>If you are experiencing hair loss on the back of your head, there are several steps you can take to address the problem. Here are some tips and tricks to help you prevent further damage and promote healthy hair growth:</p><h3>1. Improve Your Diet:</h3><p>A healthy diet is essential for promoting healthy hair growth.
