In this article, we will discuss some effective techniques and tips to stop your hair from falling out.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair loss can be a distressing and frustrating experience for both men and women. Losing hair can significantly affect your self-esteem and confidence. Hair fall can occur due to various reasons, such as hormonal changes, genetics, stress, and unhealthy lifestyle habits. However, hair fall can be prevented by adopting a healthy lifestyle and following some simple hair care practices.</p><h2>How to Stop Your Hair Falling Out</h2><h3>1.
