Look for someone who has experience cutting black male hair and is familiar with the different types of fades. When you go in for your appointment, bring a picture of the style you want to help your barber visualize the look you're going for.</p><p>There are several types of fades to choose from, including low, mid, and high fades. Low fades start at the hairline and gradually taper down to the neck, while mid fades start higher up on the head. High fades start even higher and usually leave a very short amount of hair on the sides and back of the head.</p><h3>Choosing the Right Length</h3><p>The length of your fade will depend on your personal style and the shape of your face.
