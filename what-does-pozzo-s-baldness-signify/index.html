In the play, Pozzo is often abusive towards his servant, Lucky, and his bald head may represent his dominance and superiority over someone he sees as inferior.</p><h3>Humiliation and Shame</h3><p>Finally, Pozzo's baldness may signify feelings of humiliation and shame. In the second act of the play, Pozzo appears blind and helpless, and his once-powerful demeanor is reduced to one of vulnerability and weakness.
