They will then deposit pigment into these incisions, creating the appearance of individual eyebrow hairs. The process is typically done under local anesthesia to minimize discomfort.</p><h3>Is Microblading Safe?</h3><p>When done by a qualified technician, microblading is generally considered safe. However, as with any cosmetic procedure, there is some risk of complications. These may include infection, scarring, or an allergic reaction to the pigment.
