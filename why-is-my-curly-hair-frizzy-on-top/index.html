The top layer of your hair is exposed to the elements, such as humidity and wind, which can cause the hair to become frizzy. In addition, curly hair tends to be dry, which can exacerbate frizz. The natural oils produced by the scalp have a harder time traveling down curly hair strands, leaving the ends dry and prone to breakage. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to Manage Curly Hair Frizz on Top:</h2><p>Managing curly hair frizz on top requires a combination of proper hair care and styling techniques.
