Here are the steps you need to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, damp hair</h3><p>The first step to achieving fluffy curls is to start with clean, damp hair. Shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would, and then towel dry it gently. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause frizz.</p><br/><h3>Step 2: Apply a curl-enhancing product</h3><p>Next, apply a curl-enhancing product to your hair. This can be a mousse, a gel, or a cream, depending on your hair type and the look you're going for. Work the product through your hair, making sure to distribute it evenly.</p><br/><h3>Step 3: Use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer</h3><p>Using a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer can help to enhance your natural curls and add volume. Flip your head upside down and dry your hair on a low heat setting, using the diffuser to gently scrunch your hair as you go.</p><br/><h3>Step 4: Finish with a hairspray</h3><p>To help your curls hold their shape, finish with a light hairspray. Hold the can about 10 inches away from your head and mist your hair lightly.
