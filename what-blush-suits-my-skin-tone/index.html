Avoid blushes with shimmer or glitter, as they can accentuate texture on the skin.</p><h3>Can I wear blush with a bold lip?</h3><p>Absolutely! Just make sure to choose a blush shade that complements your lip color. For example, if you're wearing a bold red lip, opt for a soft pink or coral blush.</p><p>Choosing the perfect blush shade can seem intimidating, but with these tips and tricks, you'll be able to find the right shade for your skin tone in no time.
