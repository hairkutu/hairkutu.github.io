Condition Your Hair </h3><p>Use a conditioner to help keep your hair moisturized and prevent breakage.</p><h3> 4. Avoid Tight Hairstyles </h3><p>Avoid hairstyles that pull on your hair, such as tight braids or ponytails.</p><h3> 5. Protect Your Hair </h3><p>Use hats or scarves to protect your hair from the sun and wind, which can cause damage and breakage.</p><p>By following these tips and taking care of your hair, you can promote healthier hair growth and prevent breakage.
