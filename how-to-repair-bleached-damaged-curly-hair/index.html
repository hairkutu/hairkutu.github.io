If you’re dealing with bleached damaged curly hair, don’t worry, because there are ways to repair it. The first step is to assess the damage and determine the best course of action.</p><h3>Assess the Damage</h3><p>The first thing you should do is assess the damage to your hair. Look for signs of dryness, breakage, and split ends. If your hair is severely damaged, you may need to cut it and start fresh. However, if the damage is not too severe, you can repair your hair with the following steps.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide to Repair Bleached Damaged Curly Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Moisturize Your Hair</h3><p>The first step in repairing bleached damaged curly hair is to moisturize your hair. Use a deep conditioner or hair mask to hydrate your hair. Leave the conditioner or mask on for 20-30 minutes, then rinse it off with cool water. </p><h3>Step 2: Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>Protein treatments can help repair damaged hair by strengthening the hair shaft. Look for a protein treatment that contains keratin or collagen.

Avoid using them until your hair has fully recovered.</p><h3>Step 4: Trim Your Hair</h3><p>If you have split ends or damaged hair, you should trim your hair. This will prevent further damage and promote healthy hair growth. You can trim your hair yourself or visit a professional stylist.</p><h3>Step 5: Protect Your Hair</h3><p>Protect your hair by using a silk or satin pillowcase.
