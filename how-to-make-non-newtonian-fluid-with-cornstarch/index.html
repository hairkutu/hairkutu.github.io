They become thicker and more viscous when force is applied to them. You can make non Newtonian fluid using cornstarch, which is a common household ingredient. In this article, we will discuss how to make non Newtonian fluid with cornstarch and explore some tips and FAQs about this topic. </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Cornstarch is a fine, powdery substance that is made from corn. It is commonly used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking. When mixed with water, cornstarch can create a non Newtonian fluid. This fluid has the unique property of becoming more solid-like when force is applied to it. It is a fun and easy science experiment that you can do at home with your kids or for your own entertainment.</p><h2>How to Make Non Newtonian Fluid with Cornstarch</h2><p>Making non Newtonian fluid with cornstarch is a simple process that requires only a few ingredients. Here are the steps:</p><h3>Ingredients:</h3><ul><li>1 cup of cornstarch</li><li>1/2 cup of water</li><li>Food coloring (optional)</li></ul><h3>Instructions:</h3><ol><li>In a mixing bowl, combine the cornstarch and water.</li><li>Stir the mixture until it is smooth and free of lumps.</li><li>If desired, add a few drops of food coloring to the mixture and stir until the color is evenly distributed.</li><li>Your non Newtonian fluid is now ready to use!</li></ol><p>It is important to note that this mixture can be messy and should be handled with care. It is also not recommended to pour this mixture down the drain, as it can clog your pipes. Instead, dispose of it in the trash.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you make the best non Newtonian fluid with cornstarch:</p><ul><li>Use a mixing bowl with a wide opening to make it easier to stir the mixture.</li><li>If the mixture becomes too thick, add more water to thin it out.</li><li>Experiment with different food coloring to create different colors of non Newtonian fluid.</li><li>Store the mixture in an airtight container to keep it from drying out.</li><li>Have fun and don't be afraid to get messy!</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is a non Newtonian fluid?</h3><p>A non Newtonian fluid is a substance that behaves differently from normal liquids. It becomes thicker and more viscous when force is applied to it.</p><h3>What is cornstarch?</h3><p>Cornstarch is a fine, powdery substance that is made from corn. It is commonly used as a thickening agent in cooking and baking.</p><h3>Is non Newtonian fluid safe?</h3><p>Yes, non Newtonian fluid made with cornstarch is safe to handle and play with. However, it should not be ingested and should be kept away from eyes and mouth.</p><h3>How do I dispose of non Newtonian fluid?</h3><p>Do not pour non Newtonian fluid down the drain, as it can clog your pipes. Instead, dispose of it in the trash.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Although non Newtonian fluid made with cornstarch is not intended for hair care, it is important to note that it can be messy and difficult to clean out of your hair. Avoid getting the mixture on your hair, as it may require multiple washes to remove it completely.</p><p>Making non Newtonian fluid with cornstarch is a fun and easy science experiment that you can do at home. It is a great way to teach kids about science and have fun at the same time.
