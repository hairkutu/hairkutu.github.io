This is a common concern, especially among women who have a round or fuller face. In this article, we will explore this question and provide you with tips and advice to help you make the best decision for your hair and body.</p><h2>Table of Content</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>The idea that short hair makes your body look fatter is a common myth. It is not the length of your hair that makes your body appear larger, but rather the style and cut of your hair. If you choose a hairstyle that complements your features and body type, you can look fabulous regardless of hair length. </p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Choosing the right short haircut can be a daunting task, especially if you are not sure what style will suit your face and body shape. Here are a few tips to help you choose the right short haircut:</p><h3>1. Consider your face shape</h3><p>The first step in choosing the right short haircut is to consider your face shape. Different face shapes suit different hairstyles. For example, if you have a round face, you may want to opt for a short haircut that adds height to your crown, such as a pixie cut or a short bob with layers. If you have an oval face, you can pretty much pull off any short haircut you like.</p><h3>2. Think about your body shape</h3><p>Your body shape can also influence the type of short haircut that will suit you. If you have a fuller figure, you may want to opt for a short haircut that adds volume to the top of your head and keeps the sides and back relatively short. This will create a more balanced look and make your body appear slimmer.</p><h3>3. Consider your lifestyle</h3><p>When choosing a short haircut, it is important to consider your lifestyle. If you have a busy schedule or are always on the go, you may want to opt for a low-maintenance haircut that requires minimal styling. On the other hand, if you have more time to spend on your hair, you may want to choose a more high-maintenance haircut that requires regular trims and styling.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>Here are the steps to follow when getting a short haircut:</p><h3>1. Find inspiration</h3><p>Before you head to the salon, it is a good idea to find inspiration for your new haircut. Browse magazines, websites, and social media to find pictures of short haircuts that you like.</p><h3>2. Consult with a hairstylist</h3><p>Once you have found some inspiration, book a consultation with a hairstylist. They will be able to advise you on the best short haircut for your face and body shape and offer suggestions on how to style your new haircut.</p><h3>3. Get the haircut</h3><p>Once you have decided on your new haircut, it is time to get it done. Your hairstylist will cut your hair to the desired length and style it to suit your face and body shape.</p><h3>4. Maintain your haircut</h3><p>To keep your short haircut looking great, it is important to maintain it. This means getting regular trims and styling it on a daily basis. Your hairstylist will be able to advise you on how often to get trims and how to style your new haircut.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you rock your short haircut:</p><h3>1.

Be confident and rock your new haircut with pride.</p><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Does short hair make your body look fatter?</h3><p>A: Short hair does not make your body look fatter.
