To achieve this look, ask your stylist to cut your hair into a chin-length bob. Style with a volumizing mousse to add lift to your roots.</p><br/><p>3. Layered Cut - A layered haircut is perfect for adding volume and texture to very thin hair. The layers create movement and body, while the length provides versatility. To achieve this look, ask your stylist to add layers throughout your hair. Style with a curling iron or wand to enhance the texture.</p><br/><p>4.
