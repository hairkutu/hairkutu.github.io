You’ll need a good pair of hair clippers, a handheld mirror, a regular mirror, and a comb. Once you have all these items ready, you’re good to start. </p><h3> Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair </h3><p>Start by washing your hair to remove any dirt, oil, or product buildup that may be in your hair.

Use a light touch and go slowly, making sure to trim only a little bit at a time. Use the handheld mirror to check the back of your head and make sure you’re trimming evenly. </p><h3> Step 4: Repeat on the Other Side </h3><p>Once you’ve completed one side of your hairline, repeat the process on the other side. </p><h3> Step 5: Use the Mirror to Check Your Work </h3><p>Using the regular mirror, check your hairline from all angles to make sure it’s even and looks good.
