Use a hair tie to secure it in place.</p><h3>Step 3: Twist the ponytail</h3><p>Twist the ponytail until it starts to coil around itself. Keep twisting until the entire ponytail is twisted into a tight spiral.</p><h3>Step 4: Coil the twisted ponytail</h3><p>Coil the twisted ponytail around itself to create a small bun. Tuck the end of the ponytail under the bun and secure it in place with bobby pins.</p><h3>Step 5: Secure the bun</h3><p>Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place. Make sure to hide the bobby pins so that they are not visible.</p><h3>Step 6: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>Finish with a light mist of hairspray to hold the chignon in place.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you achieve the perfect chignon:</p><ul><li>Use a hair donut or sock bun to create a fuller chignon.</li><li>Add accessories like flowers or jeweled pins to dress up your chignon.</li><li>Practice the technique a few times before wearing it to a special event.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about chignon hairstyles:</p><h3>Can I do a chignon on curly hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can do a chignon on curly hair.

It is a great hairstyle for special events because it stays in place and looks elegant all night long.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>To keep your hair healthy and strong, make sure to use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.
