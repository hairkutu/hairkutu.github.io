Do you want to learn how to cut your own hair? One of the essential techniques to master is using the clipper over comb method. In this article, we will guide you through the steps of cutting hair clipper over comb. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced barber, read on to learn more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The clipper over comb technique is a classic method used by barbers and hairstylists. It involves using a clipper and a comb to create a blended haircut. This technique is suitable for all hair types and lengths. The clipper over comb technique is an essential skill to master if you want to cut your own hair or start a career in the hair industry.</p><h2>How to Cut Hair Clipper Over Comb</h2><h3>Step 1: Preparation</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have the right tools. You will need a clipper, a comb, scissors, and a mirror. It is also essential to have a clean and dry head of hair. Start by washing and drying your hair thoroughly. Comb your hair in the direction you want it to lay. This will help you see the natural shape of your head and hairline.</p><h3>Step 2: Choosing the Right Clipper Guard</h3><p>The length of the clipper guard will determine the length of the hair. Start with a longer guard and work your way down. It is always better to start with a longer guard as you can always cut more hair, but once you cut too much, you cannot put it back. </p><h3>Step 3: Positioning the Comb and Clipper</h3><p>Once you have chosen the clipper guard, position the comb and clipper. The comb should be perpendicular to the head, and the clipper should be held at a 45-degree angle towards the comb. Use your non-dominant hand to hold the comb and your dominant hand to hold the clipper. </p><h3>Step 4: Cutting the Hair</h3><p>Start cutting the hair by moving the clipper up the comb. Make sure the clipper is in constant contact with the comb. Use small, even strokes and work your way around the head. Start from the sides and move towards the back. Pay attention to the natural shape of the head and hairline. </p><h3>Step 5: Blending the Hair</h3><p>Once you have cut the hair with the clipper over comb technique, it is time to blend the hair. Use scissors to trim any uneven hair and create a uniform length. Use the comb to comb the hair in different directions and make sure there are no visible lines. </p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve a perfect haircut using the clipper over comb technique:</p><ul><li>Use a light touch when cutting the hair</li><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down</li><li>Use scissors to trim any uneven hair</li><li>Pay attention to the natural shape of the head and hairline</li><li>Comb the hair in different directions to ensure there are no visible lines</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>What is the clipper over comb technique?</h3><p>The clipper over comb technique is a classic barbering technique used to create a blended haircut.
