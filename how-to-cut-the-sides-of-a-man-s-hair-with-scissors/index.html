You will need a pair of scissors, a comb, and a mirror. Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure the hair is clean and dry. This will make it easier to cut and ensure a more even result.</p><h3>Step 2: Comb the Hair</h3><p>Using a comb, comb the hair straight down so that it's even on both sides. Make sure there are no tangles or knots in the hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Section the Hair</h3><p>Take a small section of hair from the side of the head and hold it between your fingers. Use the comb to comb the hair straight down, and then cut the hair with the scissors at the desired length. Repeat this process for the rest of the hair on the sides of the head.</p><h3>Step 4: Check for Evenness</h3><p>After cutting the hair on both sides, use the comb to check for evenness. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure both sides are the same length.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Here are more detailed step-by-step instructions on how to cut the sides of a man's hair with scissors:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have all the necessary tools.
