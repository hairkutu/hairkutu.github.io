These gels are often thicker and more viscous than regular hair gels, which helps them hold your hair in place for longer periods of time.</p><p>Some of the best men's hair gels for long thick hair include:</p><h3>1.

Redken Brews Stand Tough Extreme Gel</h3><p>This gel is perfect for long thick hair that needs a little extra hold. It's designed to withstand humidity and last all day without flaking or leaving residue on your hair. The formula is also infused with protein to help strengthen your hair over time.</p><h3>3. Baxter of California Hard Water Pomade</h3><p>While technically not a gel, this pomade is a great alternative for long thick hair.

Here are some tips on how to use hair gel effectively:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Hair gel works best on clean, dry hair. Make sure you've washed and dried your hair thoroughly before applying any gel. You can also use a blow dryer to help dry your hair faster.</p><h3>2. Apply the gel evenly</h3><p>Squeeze a small amount of gel onto your fingers and rub them together to distribute the product evenly. Then, run your fingers through your hair, making sure to coat each strand evenly.</p><h3>3. Style your hair</h3><p>Once the gel is evenly distributed, you can begin styling your hair. Use a comb or your fingers to create the desired look. If you're going for a more natural-looking style, use your fingers to create texture and movement.</p><h3>4. Let the gel dry completely</h3><p>Allow the gel to dry completely before touching your hair. This will help the gel set and prevent it from becoming sticky or crunchy.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use hair gel for long thick hair:</p><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair thoroughly</li><li>Squeeze a small amount of gel onto your fingers</li><li>Rub your fingers together to distribute the gel evenly</li><li>Run your fingers through your hair, making sure to coat each strand evenly</li><li>Begin styling your hair using a comb or your fingers</li><li>Allow the gel to dry completely before touching your hair</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Using Hair Gel on Long Thick Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for using hair gel on long thick hair:</p><ul><li>Use a small amount of gel to avoid making your hair look greasy or weighed down</li><li>Experiment with different styles to find the one that works best for you</li><li>Don't be afraid to use a blow dryer to help set your style</li><li>Try using a hair spray to help hold your style in place even longer</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>1.

How often should I use hair gel on long thick hair?</h3><p>You can use hair gel on long thick hair as often as you like, but it's best to limit your use to a few times a week.
