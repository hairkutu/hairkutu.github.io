Why not go retro with a 60s-inspired hairdo? The 60s was a time of bold and experimental hairstyles, and many of them are still popular today. In this article, we’ll show you how to style 60s hair in a few easy steps. From the beehive to the bouffant, we’ve got you covered. Read on for our tips and tricks.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The 60s was a decade of change, both socially and culturally. In terms of fashion and beauty, it was a time of experimentation and rebellion. Hairstyles from this era were characterized by volume, height, and boldness. Women’s hair was often styled in bouffants, beehives, and flipped-out ends. Men’s hair was cut short and often styled with gel or pomade. In this article, we’ll be focusing on women’s hairstyles from the 60s.</p><h2>How to Style 60s Hair: Step-by-Step</h2><h3>Step 1: Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start styling, you’ll need to prep your hair. Wash and condition your hair as you normally would, then towel dry it. Apply a volumizing mousse or spray to your roots to add lift and texture. Blow-dry your hair using a round brush to create volume.</p><h3>Step 2: Tease Your Hair</h3><p>Teasing your hair is crucial for creating a 60s-inspired hairstyle. Take a small section of hair at the crown of your head and backcomb it using a fine-tooth comb. Repeat this process until you’ve teased the entire crown of your head.</p><h3>Step 3: Create Your Style</h3><p>Now it’s time to create your desired hairstyle. Here are a few popular 60s styles:</p><h3>The Beehive:</h3><p>To create a beehive, gather your teased hair and secure it with bobby pins at the crown of your head. Smooth out the sides of your hair and pin them in place. Finish with a strong-hold hairspray.</p><h3>The Bouffant:</h3><p>To create a bouffant, gather your teased hair and gently pull it back, creating a bump at the crown of your head. Secure with bobby pins and smooth out the sides of your hair. Finish with hairspray.</p><h3>Flipped-Out Ends:</h3><p>To create flipped-out ends, part your hair down the middle and blow-dry it straight. Use a curling iron to curl the ends of your hair outward. Finish with hairspray.</p><h2>Tips for Styling 60s Hair</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when styling your hair in a 60s-inspired look:</p><ul><li>Use a fine-tooth comb for teasing your hair.</li><li>Invest in a strong-hold hairspray to keep your style in place.</li><li>If you’re using bobby pins, try to use ones that match your hair color.</li><li>Add a headband or scarf for a fun and flirty touch.</li></ul><h2>FAQs About 60s Hair</h2><h3>Q: What hair length is best for 60s hairstyles?</h3><p>A: Most 60s hairstyles are best suited for medium-length to long hair. However, some styles, such as the flipped-out ends, can be achieved on shorter hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I style 60s hair without teasing my hair?</h3><p>A: Teasing your hair is a key component of 60s hairstyles, but you can achieve a similar look by using volumizing products and blow-drying your hair with a round brush.</p><h2>Hair Care for 60s Hair</h2><p>Styling your hair in a 60s-inspired look can be damaging to your hair if you’re not careful. Here are a few hair care tips to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant spray before blow-drying or curling your hair.</li><li>Avoid using too much hairspray, as it can dry out your hair.</li><li>Deep condition your hair once a week to keep it healthy and moisturized.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to style 60s hair, it’s time to give it a try. Whether you’re going for a retro look or just want to try something new, these hairstyles are sure to turn heads.</p></article>
