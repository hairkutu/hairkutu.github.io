You can also play with bangs or add texture to your hair with curls or waves. The key is to find a hairstyle that suits your face shape and highlights your best features.</p><h3>3. Use Makeup to Enhance Your Features</h3><p>Makeup can be a powerful tool in enhancing your features and making you feel pretty.
