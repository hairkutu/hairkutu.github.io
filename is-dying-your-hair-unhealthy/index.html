First, it's important to choose a hair dye that is safe and gentle on your hair. Look for hair dye that is free of harsh chemicals like ammonia and PPD. You may also want to consider using a semi-permanent or demi-permanent hair dye, which is less damaging than permanent hair dye.</p><p>Before you dye your hair, it's important to do a patch test to make sure you're not allergic to the hair dye.
