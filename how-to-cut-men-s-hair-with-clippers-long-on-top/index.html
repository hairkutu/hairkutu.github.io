This style is versatile and can be tailored to suit different hair types and face shapes. One of the best things about this haircut is that you can do it yourself at home with a pair of clippers. In this article, we'll show you how to cut men's hair with clippers long on top in a relaxed English language.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The long top with short sides and back haircut, also known as a disconnected undercut, features a longer length of hair on the crown and a sharp contrast between the top and sides. The sides and back are usually clippered or shaved, while the top is left longer and styled with a pomade or wax. This hairstyle has been popular among men for several years and is still going strong in 2023.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of clippers with different guard sizes, a comb, a mirror, and a spray bottle filled with water. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner, and towel dry it. You want your hair to be damp, not soaking wet. This will make it easier to cut and style.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on the Length</h3><p>Determine how long you want your hair to be on top. Use a comb to lift the hair on the crown and cut it to the desired length. You can start with a longer guard size, such as 6 or 8, and work your way down to a shorter size, depending on the length you want.</p><h3>Step 3: Clipper the Sides and Back</h3><p>Attach a shorter guard size to your clippers, such as 1 or 2, and clipper the sides and back. Start from the bottom and work your way up, using an upward motion. Make sure you blend the hair on the crown with the hair on the sides and back, so there's no harsh line.</p><h3>Step 4: Trim the Top</h3><p>Use scissors to trim any longer strands on the top that didn't get clipped with the guard. This will give the top a more natural and textured look.</p><h3>Step 5: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Apply a small amount of pomade or wax to your hands and work it through your hair, starting from the back and working your way forward. Use your fingers to style the hair on top, creating a messy or slick look, depending on your preference.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting men's hair with clippers:</p><ul><li>Start with a longer guard size and work your way down, so you don't cut too much hair at once.</li><li>Use a mirror to check the back of your head and make sure everything is even.</li><li>If you're not sure about the length, go shorter rather than longer. You can always cut more hair, but you can't put it back once it's gone.</li><li>Clean your clippers after each use to keep them in good condition.</li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about cutting men's hair with clippers:</p><h3>Q: How often should I cut my hair?</h3><p>A: It depends on how fast your hair grows and how neat you want it to look. Generally, you should cut your hair every 4-6 weeks to maintain the length and shape.</p><h3>Q: Can I cut my hair with scissors instead of clippers?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can. However, clippers are faster and more precise, especially for shorter haircuts.</p><h3>Q: Do I need to wet my hair before cutting it with clippers?</h3><p>A: Yes, it's recommended to cut damp hair because it's easier to control and cut evenly. Use a spray bottle to dampen your hair if it's dry.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After you've cut your hair, it's important to take care of it to keep it healthy and looking good. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, such as blow dryers or flat irons.</li><li>Get regular trims to keep the ends from splitting.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet and drink plenty of water to promote hair growth.</li></ul><p>With these tips and techniques, you can confidently cut your hair with clippers long on top and achieve a stylish and low-maintenance haircut at home.</p></article>
