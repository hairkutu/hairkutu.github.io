If you're not confident in your abilities, it's best to visit a professional stylist. But if you're up for the challenge, here's what you need to do:</p><h3>1. Start with Dry Hair</h3><p>It's essential to cut your hair when it's dry because curly hair tends to shrink when it dries. If you cut your hair when it's wet, you may end up cutting more than you intended, and your hair may look shorter than you wanted.</p><h3>2. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into four parts: two in the front and two in the back. Use hair clips to hold each section in place. Start with the back sections first.</p><h3>3. Cut the Back Sections</h3><p>Using hair-cutting scissors, start cutting the back sections. Start with the ends and work your way up, cutting small sections at a time. Be sure to cut the hair in a straight line, keeping the length consistent.</p><h3>4. Cut the Front Sections</h3><p>Once you've finished cutting the back sections, move on to the front sections. Use the back sections as a guide and cut the front sections to the same length. Be sure to cut the bangs to the desired length as well.</p><h3>5. Check for Symmetry</h3><p>After cutting your hair, check for symmetry by comparing both sides. If one side is longer than the other, even it out by trimming the longer side.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to cut short curly hair with bangs:</p><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair.</li><li>Section your hair into four parts.</li><li>Cut the back sections first.</li><li>Cut the front sections, including the bangs.</li><li>Check for symmetry.</li><li>Style your hair as desired.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Short Curly Hair with Bangs</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when cutting short curly hair with bangs:</p><ul><li>Invest in a good pair of hair-cutting scissors.</li><li>Start with small sections and cut slowly.</li><li>Don't cut too much off at once.</li><li>Check for symmetry throughout the cutting process.</li><li>Don't be afraid to seek professional help if you're not confident in your abilities.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can I cut my hair when it's wet?</h3><p>No, it's best to cut your hair when it's dry because curly hair tends to shrink when it dries.
