But fear not! We have put together a complete guide to help you find the perfect haircut that flatters your face shape. In this article, we will cover everything from how to identify a rectangle face shape to the best haircuts for men with rectangle faces. So, let's get started!</p><h2>What is a Rectangle Face Shape?</h2><p>A rectangle face shape is characterized by a long and narrow face with a strong jawline and forehead. The length of the face is greater than the width, and the cheekbones are not very prominent. If you have a rectangle face shape, you want to choose a haircut that adds width to the face and balances out the strong jawline.</p><h2>How to Identify Your Face Shape?</h2><p>Before we dive into the haircuts, it's essential to identify your face shape accurately. Here's how you can do it:</p><ul><li>Stand in front of a mirror with your hair pulled back.</li><li>Take a measuring tape and measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, jawline, and the length of your face.</li><li>Compare the measurements to determine your face shape.</li></ul><h3>Best Haircuts for Men with Rectangle Faces</h3><p>Now that you know your face shape let's take a look at the best haircuts for rectangle faces:</p><h4>1. Short Haircuts</h4><p>Short haircuts like buzz cuts, crew cuts, and high and tight haircuts work great for rectangle faces. These haircuts add width to the face and balance out the strong jawline. Make sure to ask your hairstylist to keep the sides short and the top a bit longer to add volume.</p><h4>2. Textured Crop Haircuts</h4><p>Textured crop haircuts are a popular choice for men with rectangle faces. This haircut adds volume and texture to the top of the head, balancing out the face's length. You can style it messy or slicked back, depending on your preference.</p><h4>3. Side Part Haircuts</h4><p>Side part haircuts work great for men with rectangle faces. This haircut adds width to the forehead and balances out the strong jawline. You can style it with a side part, slicked back, or messy.</p><h4>4. Fringe Haircuts</h4><p>Fringe haircuts are an excellent choice for men with rectangle faces. This haircut adds volume to the top of the head and softens the strong jawline. You can style it with a side part or messy fringe, depending on your preference.</p><h3>Tips for Maintaining Your Haircut</h3><p>Now that you have found the perfect haircut, it's essential to maintain it. Here are some tips to keep your haircut looking fresh:</p><ul><li>Visit your hairstylist every 4-6 weeks for a trim.</li><li>Invest in quality hair products to keep your hair looking healthy and styled.</li><li>Wash your hair every other day to avoid over-drying.</li><li>Avoid using too much heat on your hair, which can damage it.</li></ul><h3>FAQs</h3><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about rectangle face shape haircuts for men:</p><h4>1. Can I wear a beard with a rectangle face shape?</h4><p>Yes, you can wear a beard with a rectangle face shape. A well-groomed beard can help balance out the strong jawline and add width to the face.</p><h4>2.

Here are some hair care tips for men with rectangle faces:</p><ul><li>Use a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as it can weigh down your hair.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as it can strip it of its natural oils.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet and stay hydrated to promote healthy hair growth.</li></ul><p>Now that you have a complete guide to rectangle face shape haircuts for men, it's time to book an appointment with your hairstylist and try out a new haircut.
