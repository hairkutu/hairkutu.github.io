Here are the general steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Before you start braiding, make sure your hair is clean, dry, and detangled. Use a wide-tooth comb to remove any knots or tangles. Apply a leave-in conditioner or oil to your hair to keep it moisturized.</p><h3>2. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using a rattail comb or your fingers, section your hair into the desired size and shape for your braids. Larger sections will result in bigger braids, while smaller sections will create smaller braids. Use hair clips to keep each section separated.</p><h3>3. Start Braiding</h3><p>Take one section of hair and divide it into three equal parts. Cross the right section over the middle section, then cross the left section over the new middle section. Continue braiding in this pattern, adding more hair to each section as you go. Make sure to keep the tension even and tight.</p><h3>4. Finish the Braid</h3><p>When you reach the end of the section, secure the braid with a hair tie or rubber band. Repeat the process on the remaining sections of hair.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Now that you know the general process, let's break it down into a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Detangle Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair while it's wet. If you have any knots or tangles, use a detangling spray or leave-in conditioner to help loosen them.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Using a rattail comb or your fingers, section your hair into the desired size and shape for your braids. Use hair clips to keep each section separated.</p><h3>Step 3: Moisturize Your Hair</h3><p>Apply a leave-in conditioner or oil to each section of hair to keep it moisturized. This will help prevent breakage and keep your hair healthy.</p><h3>Step 4: Start Braiding</h3><p>Take one section of hair and divide it into three equal parts. Cross the right section over the middle section, then cross the left section over the new middle section. Continue braiding in this pattern, adding more hair to each section as you go. Make sure to keep the tension even and tight.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish the Braid</h3><p>When you reach the end of the section, secure the braid with a hair tie or rubber band.
