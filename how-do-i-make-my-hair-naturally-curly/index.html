Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils. After washing, gently towel dry your hair to remove excess water.</p><p>Next, apply a curl-enhancing product to your hair. This can be a mousse, gel, or cream that is specifically designed to enhance curls. Apply the product evenly throughout your hair, focusing on the ends where the curls tend to be more defined.</p><p>Divide your hair into sections and twist each section around your finger to create a curl. Be sure to twist in the direction you want your curls to go. Continue twisting until all sections of your hair are curled.</p><p>Once your hair is completely curled, leave it to air dry. Avoid touching your hair during this time, as this can disrupt the curls and cause frizz. If you are in a rush, you can use a diffuser attachment on your hair dryer to speed up the drying process.</p><p>After your hair is completely dry, gently separate the curls with your fingers.
