Make sure to use a round brush to lift your hair at the roots and create volume.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve the perfect hair style:</p><h3>1. Use heat protectant spray</h3><p>Heat protectant spray is essential for women with fine hair. This spray will help to protect your hair from heat damage and keep it healthy and strong.</p><h3>2.
