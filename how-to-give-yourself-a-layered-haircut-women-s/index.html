Clip the top section up and out of the way.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the bottom layer</h3><p>Start by cutting the bottom layer. Take a small section of hair, comb it straight down, and cut it at the desired length. Continue taking small sections and cutting them to the same length. Make sure to check the length by holding the hair up and looking in the mirror.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the middle layer</h3><p>Release the middle section of hair and cut it to the desired length, using the same technique as before.
