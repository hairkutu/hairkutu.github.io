From pixie cuts to bobs, short hair is perfect for those who want a low-maintenance style. Plus, it's perfect for the summer months when you want to keep cool. If you're feeling bold, try a buzz cut or an undercut.</p><p>When it comes to styling short hair, less is more. Use a texturizing spray or wax to add some volume and texture. Or, slick it back with some gel for a sleek look. Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and products until you find what works for you.</p><h2 id="long-hair">Long Hair</h2><p>Long hair is always in style, and this year is no exception. From beachy waves to straight and sleek, there are so many ways to style long hair. One of the most popular trends right now is the curtain bangs. This style features a center part with long, wispy bangs that frame the face.</p><p>If you have long hair, try adding some layers to give it some movement and texture. Or, add some highlights or balayage for a pop of color. Don't forget to keep it healthy by getting regular trims and using a deep conditioning treatment once a week.</p><h2 id="braids">Braids</h2><p>Braids are another trend that is here to stay. From classic French braids to intricate fishtails, braids are perfect for any occasion. They're also a great way to keep your hair out of your face during the hot summer months.</p><p>If you're not sure how to braid your hair, don't worry. There are plenty of tutorials online that can help you master the art of braiding. And, if you're feeling adventurous, try adding some beads or ribbons to your braids for a fun and playful look.</p><h2 id="ponytails">Ponytails</h2><p>Ponytails are a classic hairstyle that will never go out of style. This year, the trend is all about the low ponytail. This style features a sleek and polished look with a low ponytail at the nape of the neck.</p><p>If you want to add some texture to your ponytail, try a messy or tousled look. Or, add some accessories like a scarf or headband for a pop of color. Don't forget to use some hairspray to keep your ponytail in place all day long.</p><h2 id="bangs">Bangs</h2><p>Bangs are back in a big way this year. From blunt to wispy, there are so many different styles to choose from. One of the most popular trends right now is the shaggy bangs. This style features choppy, textured bangs that blend seamlessly into the rest of your hair.</p><p>If you're not ready to commit to bangs, try a clip-in fringe to see if you like the look. And, if you do decide to get bangs, make sure to keep them trimmed every four to six weeks to maintain their shape.</p><h2>FAQ:</h2><h3>What are the most popular hairstyles right now?</h3><p>The most popular hairstyles right now are short haircuts, long hair with curtain bangs, braids, low ponytails, and bangs.</p><h3>What is the easiest hairstyle to maintain?</h3><p>Short haircuts are the easiest hairstyle to maintain since they require little styling and upkeep.
