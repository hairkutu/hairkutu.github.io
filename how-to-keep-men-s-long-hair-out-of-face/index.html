Here are some effective methods:</p><h3>Ponytail</h3><p>The most popular and classic way to keep long hair out of your face is by tying it up in a ponytail.

Secure it with bobby pins or a hair tie for a neat and tidy look.</p><h3>Headband</h3><p>If you prefer to keep your hair down, a headband can be a great way to keep it out of your face. Choose a wide headband that can cover your forehead and push your hair back. You can also opt for a more stylish headband that matches your outfit.</p><h3>Clip or Barrette</h3><p>A clip or barrette can be a stylish way to keep your hair out of your face.
