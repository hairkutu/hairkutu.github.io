This is often due to the fact that the bottom layer of hair is subjected to more heat and styling than the top layer. The top layer of hair is typically lighter and closer to the scalp, making it less susceptible to heat damage.</p><p>This is especially true for women with longer hair, as the bottom layer is more likely to come into contact with heated styling tools. Additionally, the bottom layer of hair is often more susceptible to humidity and frizz, which can also affect the curl pattern.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Achieve Uniform Curls</h3><p>Don't worry, achieving uniform curls throughout your hair is possible!
