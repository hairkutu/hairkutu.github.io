If you have a round face, then a short haircut might not be the best option for you. This is because a round face already has a lot of fullness, and a short haircut might add more volume to it, making it look even rounder. Instead, go for a longer bob or a shoulder-length haircut that will balance out the fullness of your face.</p><p>On the other hand, if you have an oval face, then short haircuts will suit you perfectly. An oval face has balanced proportions, and a short haircut will highlight your facial features, making you look elegant and sophisticated. However, be careful not to go too short as it might make your head look disproportioned.</p><p>If you have a square face, then short haircuts can work wonders for you. A square face has a strong jawline, and a short haircut will soften the angles of your face, giving you a more feminine look. You can go for a pixie cut or a short bob to achieve this look.</p><h2 id="tips-for-rocking">Tips for Rocking Short Hair with a Big Head</h2><p>Now that you know how to determine whether short hair suits big heads, here are some tips to help you rock your short hair:</p><ol><li>Accessorize: Adding some accessories like earrings or a headband can help balance out the proportions of your head.</li><li>Highlight your facial features: Short haircuts can highlight your facial features like your cheekbones and eyes, so make sure to play them up with makeup.</li><li>Experiment with different styles: Short haircuts are versatile and can be styled in many ways.
