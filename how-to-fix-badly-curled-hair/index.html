Choose a curling iron that is the same size as your original curls. 3. Use a hairbrush: If your curls are too tight, you can use a hairbrush to loosen them up. Brush your hair gently from the roots to the ends. <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Fixing Badly Curled Hair</h2> Here is a step-by-step guide to fixing badly curled hair: 1. Start by brushing your hair to remove any tangles. 2. Section your hair into small sections using hair clips. 3. Use a straightener or curling iron to touch up your curls. 4.
