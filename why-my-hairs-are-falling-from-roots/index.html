If yes, then you are not alone. Hair fall from roots is one of the most common hair problems people face these days. There can be many reasons for hair fall, including genetics, age, hormonal changes, stress, medications, and poor hair care habits. In this article, we will discuss in detail why your hairs are falling from roots and what you can do to prevent it from happening.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair loss is a natural process that occurs in everyone's life. However, excessive hair loss can be a sign of an underlying health condition or poor hair care habits. Hair fall from roots means that the hair is falling out from the root of the hair follicle, which can cause thinning hair, bald spots, or complete baldness.</p><h2>How to Identify Hair Fall From Roots?</h2><p>If you are experiencing hair fall, it is essential to identify whether it is falling from the roots or breaking off from the middle or ends.

Avoid using heat styling tools like straighteners, curling irons, and hairdryers.
