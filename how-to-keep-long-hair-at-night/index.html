Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Braiding your hair before bed can help prevent tangles and knots. It also helps keep your hair from getting tangled while you sleep. You can try different types of braids, such as a fishtail braid, a French braid, or a simple three-strand braid.</p><h3>3. Use a Hair Wrap</h3><p>A hair wrap is a great way to keep your hair in place while you sleep. You can use a hair wrap to keep your hair from getting tangled or to keep your hair in a specific style.
