You may not be able to experiment with as many hairstyles or hair accessories.</li><li>Short hair can require more frequent trips to the salon for trims and touch-ups.</li></ul><h2>How to Decide Which Look is Right for You</h2><p>So, how do you decide whether long or short straight hair is right for you? Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Consider your face shape. Certain styles may flatter your features more than others.</li><li>Think about your lifestyle.
