First, you want to look for tops that have some sort of padding or lining to add a bit of volume.

First, consider your personal style and what you feel comfortable wearing. If you prefer a more modest look, a high-neck top or a halter top with a full coverage cup might be a good choice. If you're more of a risk-taker, a bandeau top or a triangle top with a bold print or color might be more your style.</p><p>Another important factor to consider is your body shape. If you have a more athletic build, a top with a bit of padding or ruching can help create the illusion of curves.
