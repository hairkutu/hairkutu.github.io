Some popular styles for little girls include a bob, a pixie cut, or a layered haircut. Once you've chosen your desired style, you can start cutting the hair.</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry the Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your child's hair and drying it thoroughly. Comb out any tangles or knots, and section off the hair into manageable sections using hair clips.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Sides</h3><p>Begin by cutting the sides of the hair. Hold the hair at a 45-degree angle away from the head, and cut in a straight line to the desired length. Repeat on the other side, and check that both sides are even.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Back</h3><p>Next, move on to the back of the head. Hold the hair straight up, and cut in a straight line to the desired length. Use the previous sections as a guide to ensure that the back is even.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top</h3><p>Finally, cut the top of the hair. Hold the hair at a 90-degree angle away from the head, and cut in a straight line to the desired length.
