It is natural to lose some hair every day, but if you are shedding a lot of hair in the shower, it can be concerning. So, is it normal to lose hair during shower?</p><p>The answer is yes, it is normal to lose hair during shower. It is a natural part of the hair growth cycle. Hair goes through three phases of growth: the anagen phase (active growth phase), the catagen phase (transitional phase), and the telogen phase (resting phase). During the telogen phase, the hair falls out naturally.

However, if you are losing more than that, you may want to speak to a healthcare provider.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can cause hair loss. When you are under stress, your body produces hormones that can affect your hair growth cycle.</p><h3>Q: Can diet affect hair loss?</h3><p>A: Yes, diet can affect hair loss.
