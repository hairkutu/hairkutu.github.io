Hair follicles are small pockets in the scalp where hair grows from. The shape of the hair follicle determines the shape of the hair shaft. Straight hair has round hair follicles, while curly hair has oval or flat hair follicles.</p><p>Curly hair also tends to be drier than straight hair because the oils produced by the scalp have a harder time traveling down the hair shaft. This means that curly hair requires more moisture and hydration than straight hair.</p><h3>Genetics</h3><p>Genetics play a big role in determining whether a person's hair will be curly or straight. The genes that determine hair texture are passed down from parents to their children. If both parents have curly hair, there's a good chance their children will have curly hair too.</p><p>However, genetics aren't the only factor that determines hair texture. Environmental factors, such as climate and hair care practices, can also affect the shape and texture of hair.</p><h2 id="section2">How to Embrace Your Curly Hair</h2><p>If you have curly hair, it's important to embrace it and learn how to work with it.
