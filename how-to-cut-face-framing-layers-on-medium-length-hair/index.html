Divide your hair into a top, middle, and bottom section. Clip the top section out of the way so it doesn't get in the way of the cutting process.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Bottom Layers</h3><p>Start with the bottom section of your hair. Comb through your hair and make sure it is free of tangles. Take a small section of hair, about 1-2 inches wide, and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your index and middle fingers, and cut the hair at a slight angle, starting from the middle of the hair strand and cutting towards the ends. This will create a graduated effect, with the hair being shorter towards the back and longer towards the front.</p><p>Continue cutting small sections of hair in this manner until you have completed the bottom layer of your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Middle Layers</h3><p>Let down the middle section of your hair and repeat the same process as above. Cut small sections of hair at a slight angle, starting from the middle of the hair strand and cutting towards the ends. This will create a seamless transition from the bottom layer to the middle layer.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Top Layers</h3><p>Finally, let down the top section of your hair and repeat the same process as above. Cut small sections of hair at a slight angle, starting from the middle of the hair strand and cutting towards the ends. This will create a seamless transition from the middle layer to the top layer.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step</h2><p>To recap, here are the steps to cutting face framing layers on medium length hair:</p><ol><li>Section your hair into three parts.</li><li>Cut the bottom layers.</li><li>Cut the middle layers.</li><li>Cut the top layers.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are a few tips to keep in mind when cutting face framing layers on medium length hair:</p><ul><li>Make sure your hair is dry or slightly damp.
