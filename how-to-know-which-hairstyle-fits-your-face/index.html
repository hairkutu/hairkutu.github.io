There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. To determine your face shape, follow these simple steps:</p><h3>Oval Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oval face shape, your forehead is slightly wider than your chin, and your face is longer than it is wide. The jawline is slightly rounded, and the cheekbones are the widest part of your face.</p><h3>Round Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a round face shape, your face is nearly as wide as it is long, and your cheekbones are the widest part of your face. Your forehead and jawline are rounded, and your chin is less defined.</p><h3>Square Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a square face shape, your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all roughly the same width. Your face is angular, with a strong, square jawline.</p><h3>Heart Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a heart face shape, your forehead is wider than your jawline, and your chin is pointed. Your cheekbones are the widest part of your face.</p><h3>Diamond Face Shape</h3><p>If you have a diamond face shape, your cheekbones are the widest part of your face, and your forehead and jawline are narrower. Your chin is pointed.</p><h3>Oblong Face Shape</h3><p>If you have an oblong face shape, your face is longer than it is wide, with a straight, narrow jawline.
