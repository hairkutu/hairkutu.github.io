Air drying hair does not cause frizz by itself, but the way you air dry your hair can contribute to frizz. Frizz is caused by a lack of moisture in the hair or too much humidity in the air. When you air dry your hair, the moisture in the hair evaporates, causing the hair to become dry and brittle. If you live in a humid environment, the moisture in the air can cause the hair to absorb the excess moisture, leading to frizz. However, there are ways to air dry your hair without causing frizz.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Air Dry Your Hair Without Frizz</h2><p>The key to air drying your hair without frizz is to keep your hair moisturized and to avoid manipulating it while it dries.
