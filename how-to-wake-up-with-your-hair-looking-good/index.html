Here’s what you need to do:</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Pillowcase</h3><p>The type of pillowcase you use can affect how your hair looks in the morning. Silk or satin pillowcases are great options as they reduce friction, which can cause frizziness and breakage. These pillowcases also help to retain moisture, which is essential for healthy-looking hair.</p><h3>2. Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Braiding your hair before going to bed can help to maintain its shape and prevent tangles. You can choose to do a simple braid or a more complex style like a French braid. Make sure to tie the end of the braid with a hairband to keep it in place.</p><h3>3. Use Hair Rollers</h3><p>If you want to add some volume or curls to your hair, using hair rollers before going to bed can do the trick. Roll your hair around the rollers and secure them with clips. In the morning, gently remove the rollers and style your hair as desired.</p><h3>4. Apply Hair Oil or Serum</h3><p>Before going to bed, apply a small amount of hair oil or serum to your hair. This will help to keep your hair moisturized and prevent frizziness.
