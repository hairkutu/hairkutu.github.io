The key is to start with clean, detangled hair and to work in small sections.

Be sure to detangle your hair before braiding by using a wide-tooth comb or your fingers.

The size of the sections will depend on the length of your hair and the thickness of the braids you want to create. For short hair, you may need to create smaller sections.</p><h3>Step 3: Begin Braiding</h3><p>Start by taking a small section of hair from the front of your head and dividing it into three strands. Cross the right strand over the middle strand, then cross the left strand over the middle strand. Continue braiding in this pattern, adding more hair to each strand as you go.</p><p>For short hair, you may need to use smaller sections of hair and braid more tightly to create the desired look.</p><h3>Step 4: Continue Braiding</h3><p>Once you have completed one row of braids, move on to the next section of hair and repeat the braiding process.
