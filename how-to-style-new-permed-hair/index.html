You now have bouncy, beautiful curls that can be styled in a variety of ways. However, styling permed hair can be a bit tricky, especially if you're new to the game. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of styling new permed hair, including how to prepare your hair, what products to use, and styling tips and tricks. Let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#preparation">Preparing Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#products">Choosing the Right Products</a></li><li><a href="#styling">Styling Your Permed Hair</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips and Tricks</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#care">Hair Care Tips</a></li></ul><h2 id="preparation">Preparing Your Hair</h2><p>Before you start styling your permed hair, it's important to prepare your hair properly. This means washing your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner. Sulfates can be harsh on permed hair and can lead to frizz and dryness.</p><p>After washing your hair, gently towel dry your hair by squeezing out excess water. Do not rub your hair vigorously with the towel as this can cause frizz and damage to your curls. </p><p>Next, apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to your hair. This will help to detangle your hair and define your curls. </p><h2 id="products">Choosing the Right Products</h2><p>Choosing the right products for your permed hair is crucial in ensuring your curls look their best. Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair, such as curl creams, gels, and mousses. </p><p>When choosing products for your permed hair, avoid products that contain sulfates, as mentioned earlier. Sulfates can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry and frizzy. </p><p>Another product to avoid is alcohol-based products, such as hairspray. Alcohol can be drying to the hair and can cause your curls to become brittle and break. </p><h2 id="styling">Styling Your Permed Hair</h2><p>Now that your hair is prepped and you have the right products, it's time to style your permed hair. The following steps will guide you through the process:</p><ol><li>Start by parting your hair as desired.</li><li>Next, apply your chosen styling product to your hair. Start with a small amount and add more as needed.</li><li>Using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer, dry your hair on a low heat setting. This will help to set your curls and add volume.</li><li>Once your hair is dry, use a curling iron to touch up any areas that need more definition.</li><li>Finish off your style with a light hold hairspray.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips and Tricks</h2><p>Here are some additional tips and tricks to help you style your permed hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry. This can cause frizz and breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair when it's wet.</li><li>Sleep with your hair in a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent frizz.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about styling permed hair:</p><h3>How often should I wash my permed hair?</h3><p>You should aim to wash your permed hair no more than twice a week. Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and cause it to become dry and frizzy.</p><h3>Can I straighten my permed hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can straighten your permed hair, but it's important to be careful. Use a heat protectant spray before straightening your hair and use a low heat setting. Straightening your hair too often can cause damage to your curls.</p><h2 id="care">Hair Care Tips</h2><p>Here are some additional hair care tips to keep in mind when styling your permed hair:</p><ul><li>Avoid using hot tools on your hair too often. Excessive heat can cause damage to your curls.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends.</li><li>Avoid using hair elastics with metal parts, as they can cause breakage and damage to your curls.</li></ul><p>By following these tips and tricks, you'll be able to style your permed hair like a pro.
