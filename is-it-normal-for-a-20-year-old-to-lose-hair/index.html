Generally, losing 50 to 100 hairs per day is considered normal. However, if you notice excessive hair shedding, bald patches, or a receding hairline, it may indicate an underlying health issue.</p><h3>Step by Step Guide</h3><p>1. Observe your hair shedding pattern for a week. Count the number of hairs you lose daily.</p><p>2. Consult a dermatologist if you notice excessive hair shedding or bald patches.</p><p>3.
