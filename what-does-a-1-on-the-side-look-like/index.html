If you're not familiar with this haircut, it's a style where the hair on the sides and back of the head is cut to a length of 1/8 inch. The hair on the top of the head can be styled in various ways, depending on personal preference. In this article, we'll go over what a 1 on the side looks like, how to get it, tips for maintaining it, and more.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A 1 on the side haircut is a short, clean-cut style that's perfect for men who want a low-maintenance look. The hair on the sides and back of the head is cut to a length of 1/8 inch using clippers. This length is short enough to create a clean, streamlined look, but not so short that the scalp is visible. The hair on the top of the head can be left longer or styled in various ways, such as a crew cut, a quiff, or a slicked-back style.</p><h2>How to Get a 1 on the Side Haircut</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a 1 on the side haircut, here's how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose a Barber</h3><p>Choose a barber who is experienced in giving short haircuts. Look for a barber who has a good reputation and reviews.

This will help them understand exactly what you're looking for.</p><h3>Step 3: Get Your Hair Cut</h3><p>Sit back and let your barber work their magic. They'll use clippers to cut the hair on the sides and back of your head to a length of 1/8 inch. They may use scissors to trim the hair on the top of your head, depending on the style you want.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining a 1 on the Side Haircut</h2><p>Now that you have a 1 on the side haircut, here are some tips for maintaining it:</p><h3>Tip 1: Get Regular Trims</h3><p>To keep your haircut looking fresh, get regular trims every 4-6 weeks.

Use a good shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair clean and healthy. Use a styling product, such as pomade or gel, to create your desired look.</p><h3>Tip 3: Protect Your Hair From the Sun</h3><p>The sun can damage your hair and scalp, causing dryness and breakage. Wear a hat or use a hair product with SPF to protect your hair from the sun.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: Is a 1 on the side haircut suitable for all face shapes?</h3><p>A: Yes, a 1 on the side haircut can be adapted to suit any face shape.
