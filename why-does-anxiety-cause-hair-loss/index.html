One of the most common is a condition called telogen effluvium, which is characterized by the sudden shedding of hair strands from the scalp. This condition occurs when the body experiences a significant amount of stress, such as during a traumatic event or prolonged anxiety.</p><p>During times of stress, the body enters a state of fight-or-flight response, which triggers the release of hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline. These hormones can affect the hair growth cycle by pushing hair follicles into the resting phase, known as telogen. This results in a decrease in hair growth and an increase in hair shedding, leading to noticeable hair loss over time.</p><h2 id="hair-loss-types">Types of Hair Loss Associated with Anxiety</h2><p>In addition to telogen effluvium, anxiety can also cause other types of hair loss, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Alopecia areata:</strong> This is an autoimmune condition that causes patchy hair loss on the scalp, face, and other areas of the body. It is thought to be triggered by stress and anxiety.</li><li><strong>Trichotillomania:</strong> This is a compulsive disorder that involves pulling out hair from the scalp, eyebrows, and other areas of the body. It is often triggered by feelings of anxiety and stress.</li><li><strong>Traction alopecia:</strong> This is a type of hair loss that occurs when hair is pulled tightly, such as with tight braids or ponytails.
