Layering your curls can add dimension and body to your locks, giving you the voluminous look you desire. In this article, we will discuss how to layer curly hair for volume, step by step.

The goal is to create layers that blend seamlessly with your curls and add body rather than weigh them down.</p><h3>1. Choose the Right Stylist</h3><p>Before you start layering your curls, it's crucial to find a stylist who is experienced in working with curly hair. They will be able to assess your hair's texture, density, and curl pattern to create the perfect layered cut for you. Look for a stylist who has a portfolio of layered curly haircuts and positive reviews from curly-haired clients.</p><h3>2. Determine Your Desired Length and Layers</h3><p>Before you head to the salon, decide how much length you want to keep and how many layers you want. If you have long hair, you may only need a few layers to add volume. If you have shorter hair, you may need more layers to create shape and movement. Communicate your goals with your stylist, and they will work with you to create a layered cut that meets your needs.</p><h3>3. Consider the Shape of Your Face</h3><p>The shape of your face can influence how your curls fall and how much volume you can achieve with layering. For instance, if you have a round face, longer layers can elongate your features and create the illusion of a slimmer face. If you have a square face, shorter layers can soften your jawline and add dimension to your curls. Talk to your stylist about how to create a layered cut that flatters your face shape.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Layering Process</h2><p>Now that you know what to consider before layering your curls, let's dive into the step-by-step process of how to layer curly hair for volume.</p><h3>1. Start with Clean, Dry Hair</h3><p>Wash and dry your hair before your appointment. Your stylist needs to see your curls in their natural state to create a layered cut that complements your curls' texture and shape.</p><h3>2. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Your stylist will divide your hair into sections to create a layered cut that adds volume and movement throughout your curls. They may use clips or hair ties to keep each section separated.</p><h3>3. Cut the Bottom Layer</h3><p>Your stylist will start by cutting the bottom layer of your hair, creating a foundation for the rest of the layers. They will typically cut a straight line across the bottom, ensuring that it is even and free of split ends.</p><h3>4. Cut the Middle Layer</h3><p>Your stylist will then move on to the middle layer, which should be shorter than the bottom layer. They will typically cut this layer at an angle, creating a gradual slope that adds volume and shape to your curls.</p><h3>5. Cut the Top Layer</h3><p>The top layer should be the shortest and most layered. Your stylist will cut this layer at an angle, creating shorter pieces that frame your face and add volume to your curls. They may also use thinning shears to remove bulk and add texture to your curls.</p><h3>6. Blend the Layers</h3><p>Your stylist will blend the layers by using point cutting or feathering techniques. This ensures that the layers blend seamlessly with your curls and add dimension without creating any harsh lines.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Layering Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you achieve the best results when layering your curly hair for volume:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to keep your curls moisturized and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using heavy products that can weigh down your curls and make them look flat.</li><li>Consider getting a curly-hair-specific haircut, like the DevaCut, which is designed to enhance your natural curls.</li><li>Use a diffuser when blow-drying your hair to maintain your curls' shape and reduce frizz.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Can layering damage curly hair?</h3><p>Layering curly hair should not damage your hair if done correctly by a skilled stylist. However, if the layers are cut too short or too aggressively, they can create frizz and make your curls look uneven.</p><h3>How often should you get your curly hair layered?</h3><p>It depends on your hair's growth rate and how quickly your layers lose their shape. On average, you should get your curly hair layered every three to six months to maintain your curls' shape and volume.</p><h3>Can you layer curly hair at home?</h3><p>We do not recommend layering your curly hair at home, as it requires a skilled stylist who understands how to cut curly hair properly. Attempting to layer your hair at home can result in uneven layers, frizz, and damage to your curls.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Layered Curly Hair</h2><p>After you've layered your curly hair for volume, it's essential to maintain your curls' health and shape. Here are some hair care tips for layered curly hair:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers to detangle your hair gently.</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner to keep your curls moisturized and healthy.</li><li>Avoid using heat styling tools, which can damage your curls and make them lose their shape.</li><li>Use a microfiber towel or T-shirt to dry your hair instead of a regular towel, which can create frizz.</li><li>Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to reduce friction and prevent frizz.</li></ul><p>Now that you know how to layer curly hair for volume, it's time to book your appointment with a skilled stylist and get the voluminous curls of your dreams.
