Let it air dry or use a microfiber towel to blot it dry.</li><li><strong>Massage your scalp:</strong> Massaging your scalp can stimulate hair growth and reduce shedding.</li><li><strong>Take hair supplements:</strong> Hair supplements, such as biotin or collagen, can support hair growth and reduce shedding.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Is it normal to shed hair every day?</h3><p>A: Yes, it's normal to shed 50 to 100 hairs a day.</p><h3>Q: Can stress cause hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, stress can disrupt the hair growth cycle and cause shedding.</p><h3>Q: Can diet affect hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, a poor diet lacking in essential nutrients can lead to hair loss.</p><h3>Q: Can heat styling tools cause hair shedding?</h3><p>A: Yes, heat styling tools can damage the hair and cause it to fall out.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips to Reduce Shedding</h2><p>Here are some hair care tips to reduce shedding:</p><ul><li><strong>Wash your hair less often:</strong> Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, leading to dryness and shedding.
