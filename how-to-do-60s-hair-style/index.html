The hairstyles of the era were bold, voluminous, and playful. If you want to channel your inner 60s icon, this guide will show you how to do a 60s hair style from the comfort of your own home. </p><h2> Description </h2><p> The 60s hair style was all about big hair, lots of volume, and a playful attitude. This look can be achieved with a few simple tools and techniques, and is perfect for a night out or a special occasion. </p><h2> How to </h2><p> To get started on your 60s hair style, you'll need a few tools and products. Here's what you'll need: </p><ul><li> A round brush </li><li> Hair clips </li><li> Hairspray </li><li> A curling iron </li><li> A teasing comb </li></ul><p> Once you have your tools, you're ready to begin. Follow these steps: </p><h3> Step 1: Prep Your Hair </h3><p> Start by washing and conditioning your hair. Towel dry your hair until it is damp, but not dripping wet. Apply a heat protectant to your hair to prevent damage from the curling iron. </p><h3> Step 2: Create Volume </h3><p> Using your round brush and hair dryer, create volume at the crown of your head by lifting your hair up and away from your scalp as you blow dry. Once your hair is dry, clip the top section of your hair up and out of the way. </p><h3> Step 3: Curl Your Hair </h3><p> Using a curling iron, curl the bottom section of your hair. Once you've curled a section, wrap it around your finger and pin it to your scalp with a hair clip. Continue curling and pinning sections of your hair until you've curled all of your hair. </p><h3> Step 4: Tease Your Hair </h3><p> Using your teasing comb, gently backcomb the top section of your hair to create volume and texture. Be careful not to tease too aggressively, as this can damage your hair. </p><h3> Step 5: Set Your Hair </h3><p> Once you've teased your hair to your desired level of volume and texture, spray it with hairspray to set the style. </p><h2> Tips </h2><ul><li> Use a smaller curling iron for tighter curls, or a larger curling iron for looser curls. </li><li> Be careful not to pull too hard on your hair when teasing, as this can cause breakage. </li><li> If your hair is particularly fine or thin, you may want to use a volumizing mousse or spray before blow drying. </li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><h3> Can I do a 60s hair style on short hair? </h3><p> Yes! You can still achieve a 60s look with shorter hair. Just focus on creating volume and texture at the crown of your head, and curl the ends of your hair to create a playful, flirty look. </p><h3> Can I do a 60s hair style without a curling iron? </h3><p> Yes! You can use rollers or even bobby pins to create curls in your hair. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> To keep your hair healthy and looking its best, make sure to use a deep conditioner once a week. Avoid using too much heat on your hair, and use a heat protectant when you do use heat styling tools. Finally, be gentle with your hair when brushing and styling, and avoid pulling too hard or using too much tension. </p><p> With these tips and techniques, you'll be able to achieve a playful, 60s hair style in no time. Have fun experimenting with different variations of the look, and don't be afraid to make it your own! </p></article>
