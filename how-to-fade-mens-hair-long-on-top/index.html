The fade is a classic men's haircut that's been popular for decades, and adding a longer top section gives it a modern twist. In this guide, we'll show you how to fade men's hair long on top in a few easy steps. </p><h2> Description </h2><p> A long-on-top fade is a haircut that features short hair on the sides and back that gradually gets longer as it approaches the top of the head. The top section is left longer and can be styled in a variety of ways, from slicked back to messy and textured. This haircut is versatile, easy to maintain, and looks great on almost any face shape. </p><h2> How to </h2><p> Here's how to fade men's hair long on top: </p><h3> Step 1: Choose Your Length </h3><p> Before you start cutting, decide how long you want the top section to be. This will depend on your personal preference and the shape of your face. A good rule of thumb is to keep the top section at least 2-3 inches long. </p><h3> Step 2: Cut the Top Section </h3><p> Using a pair of scissors or clippers, cut the top section of the hair to your desired length. To achieve a more natural look, use a point-cutting technique to create texture and avoid choppy lines. </p><h3> Step 3: Blend the Sides </h3><p> Use clippers to gradually blend the sides and back into the longer top section. Start with a longer guard and work your way down to a shorter guard to create a seamless transition. </p><h3> Step 4: Clean Up the Neckline </h3><p> Use clippers or scissors to clean up the neckline and create a neat, tapered look. </p><h3> Step 5: Style Your Hair </h3><p> Style your hair using your preferred technique. You can use a pomade or wax to create a slicked-back look, or use a texturizing spray for a more messy, tousled look. </p><h2> Tips </h2><p> Here are some tips to keep in mind when fading men's hair long on top: </p><ul><li>Use a comb to guide your clippers and create a more even blend.</li><li>Start with a longer guard and work your way down to avoid cutting too much too quickly.</li><li>Use a point-cutting technique to create texture on the top section and avoid choppy lines.</li><li>Use a texturizing spray or sea salt spray to add volume and texture to your hair.</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape of your haircut.</li></ul><h2> FAQ </h2><p> Here are some frequently asked questions about fading men's hair long on top: </p><h3> How long does it take to fade men's hair long on top? </h3><p> The length of time it takes to fade men's hair long on top depends on the length of your hair and the complexity of the haircut.

However, if you're not confident in your skills, it's best to leave it to a professional. </p><h3> What face shapes look best with a long-on-top fade? </h3><p> A long-on-top fade looks great on almost any face shape, but it's particularly flattering on those with oval, square, or heart-shaped faces. </p><h2> Hair Care </h2><p> To keep your long-on-top fade looking fresh and stylish, it's important to take good care of your hair. Here are some tips: </p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools like flat irons and blow dryers, as they can damage your hair.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to keep your hair hydrated and nourished.</li><li>Get regular trims to maintain the shape of your haircut.</li><li>Avoid over-styling your hair with too many products, as this can weigh it down and make it look greasy.</li></ul><p> With these tips and techniques, you can achieve a stylish long-on-top fade that's both trendy and easy to maintain. </p></article>
