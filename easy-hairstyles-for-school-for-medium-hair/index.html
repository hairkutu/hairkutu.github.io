Do you want to switch up your look without spending hours in front of the mirror? Look no further! Here are some easy hairstyles for school for medium hair that will make you the envy of your classmates.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Medium hair can be tricky to style, but it doesn't have to be.

From braids to buns, there are plenty of options to choose from.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To create these easy hairstyles, you'll need a few basic tools: a brush or comb, hair elastics, bobby pins, and hairspray. Depending on the style, you may also need a curling iron or straightener.</p><h3>1. Half-Up Half-Down</h3><p>This classic hairstyle is perfect for medium-length hair. Simply gather the top half of your hair and secure it with a hair elastic. You can leave the bottom half straight or add some loose curls for a more polished look.</p><h3>2. Braided Crown</h3><p>This elegant hairstyle is surprisingly easy to create. Simply braid two sections of hair on either side of your head and secure them at the back with bobby pins. You can also add some flowers or other hair accessories for a more bohemian vibe.</p><h3>3. Messy Bun</h3><p>The messy bun is a staple hairstyle for school. To create this look, gather your hair into a high ponytail and twist it into a bun. Secure it with bobby pins and pull out a few strands to create a messy, effortless look.</p><h2>Step by step</h2><h3>1.
