It is a common issue that arises when the hair is subjected to excessive bleaching. Bleaching removes the natural pigment from your hair, making it brittle, dry, and prone to breakage. However, there are ways to fix your over bleached hair and restore it to its original state. In this article, we will show you how to fix your over bleached hair with easy-to-follow steps and tips.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Over bleached hair occurs when the hair is subjected to excessive bleaching. This can lead to hair breakage, dryness, and brittle strands. It is essential to take proper care of your hair to prevent it from becoming over bleached.</p><h2>How to Fix My Over Bleached Hair</h2><h3>Step 1: Stop Bleaching Your Hair</h3><p>The first step to fixing your over bleached hair is to stop bleaching it. If you continue to bleach your hair, it will only worsen your hair condition. Give your hair a break from bleach and let it recover.</p><h3>Step 2: Trim Your Hair</h3><p>The next step is to trim your hair. Trimming your hair will help get rid of the damaged ends and promote hair growth. It is essential to trim your hair regularly to maintain healthy hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>A protein treatment can help repair your over bleached hair. Look for a protein treatment that contains keratin, which is a natural protein found in hair. The keratin will help strengthen your hair and make it more resistant to breakage.</p><h3>Step 4: Use a Deep Conditioning Treatment</h3><p>A deep conditioning treatment can help restore moisture to your over bleached hair. Look for a deep conditioning treatment that contains natural oils like coconut oil, argan oil, or olive oil. These oils will help nourish your hair and make it soft and manageable.</p><h3>Step 5: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Avoid heat styling your over bleached hair as much as possible. Heat styling tools like flat irons, curling irons, and blow dryers can further damage your hair. If you must use heat styling tools, use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.</p><h3>Step 6: Use a Clarifying Shampoo</h3><p>Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any buildup from your over bleached hair. Buildup can make your hair look dull and lifeless. A clarifying shampoo will help remove the buildup and leave your hair looking shiny and healthy.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>- Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair to prevent breakage.</p><p>- Avoid brushing your hair when it is wet as it is more prone to breakage.</p><p>- Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent friction and breakage.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can I dye my over bleached hair?</h3><p>It is not recommended to dye your over bleached hair as it can cause further damage. Wait until your hair has fully recovered before dyeing it.</p><h3>How long will it take for my over bleached hair to recover?</h3><p>The recovery time for over bleached hair varies from person to person. It can take several months to a year for your hair to fully recover.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>Taking care of your hair is essential to prevent over bleaching. Here are some tips to keep your hair healthy:</p><p>- Use a sulfate-free shampoo</p><p>- Use a conditioner after shampooing your hair</p><p>- Avoid using hot water to wash your hair</p><p>- Protect your hair from the sun by wearing a hat or using a UV protectant spray</p><p>With these tips, you can fix your over bleached hair and restore it to its original state. Remember to be patient and take good care of your hair. If you need further assistance, consult a hair care professional.</p></article>
