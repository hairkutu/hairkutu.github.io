If you're looking to start your own dreads, then this guide is for you. In this article, we'll go over how to start dreads with medium length hair, including tips and hair care advice.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to Start Dreads with Medium Length Hair</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Starting Dreads</a></li><li><a href="#faq">Frequently Asked Questions</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Dreads</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Start Dreads with Medium Length Hair</h2><p>Starting dreads with medium length hair is a process that requires patience and dedication. It's important to know that everyone's hair is different, so your experience may vary. However, there are some general steps you can follow to start your own dreads.</p><h3>1. Decide on the Method</h3><p>There are several methods for starting dreadlocks, including backcombing, twisting, and freeform. Backcombing involves teasing the hair and rolling it into a tight coil. Twisting involves twisting sections of hair with a product like beeswax or locking gel. Freeform is a more natural method that involves letting the hair clump and knot on its own. Choose the method that works best for you and your hair type.</p><h3>2. Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Before starting your dreads, it's important to wash your hair thoroughly. Use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product buildup or oils. This will help your hair knot more easily and prevent any bacteria growth.</p><h3>3. Divide Your Hair into Sections</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections using clips or rubber bands. The size of the sections will depend on the method you've chosen and the size of the dreads you want. Use a comb or your fingers to separate the sections evenly.</p><h3>4. Start the Dreadlocks</h3><p>Start your dreads by using your chosen method. If you're backcombing, tease the hair in each section and roll it into a tight coil. If you're twisting, apply a product like beeswax or locking gel to each section and twist it tightly. If you're freeforming, simply let the hair clump and knot on its own. Repeat this process for each section of hair.</p><h3>5. Maintain Your Dreads</h3><p>Maintaining your dreads is essential to keeping them healthy and looking their best. This includes washing them regularly, using a residue-free shampoo, and separating any sections that are starting to merge. You may also want to palm roll or retwist your dreads periodically to keep them tight.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide to starting dreadlocks with medium length hair:</p><ol><li>Decide on the method you want to use.</li><li>Wash your hair thoroughly with a clarifying shampoo.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections using clips or rubber bands.</li><li>Start the dreadlocks using your chosen method.</li><li>Maintain your dreads by washing them regularly and separating any sections that are starting to merge.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Starting Dreads</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for starting dreadlocks:</p><ul><li>Be patient.

However, it's important to wait until your hair has grown out enough to hold a dread.

This depends on factors like hair type, length, and the method used to start the dreads.</p><h3>Can I wash my hair with dreads?</h3><p>Yes, you can and should wash your hair with dreads.
