Here are the basic steps to follow:</p><h3>1. Prep Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products designed for curly hair. Apply a leave-in conditioner or curl cream to help define your curls and reduce frizz.</p><h3>2. Blow-Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer, dry your hair on low heat, scrunching your curls as you go. This will help enhance your natural curl pattern and prevent frizz.</p><h3>3. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Divide your hair into sections, starting at the nape of your neck and working your way up. Use hair clips to secure each section as you go.</p><h3>4. Choose Your Curling Iron</h3><p>For best results, use a curling iron with a barrel size of 1 inch or smaller. This will help create tighter, more defined curls that last longer.</p><h3>5. Apply Heat Protectant</h3><p>Before curling each section, apply a heat protectant spray or cream to prevent damage to your hair.</p><h3>6. Curl Your Hair</h3><p>Starting at the roots, wrap a small section of hair around the curling iron barrel, holding for 10-15 seconds. Release the curl and let it cool in your hand before moving on to the next section.</p><h3>7. Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Once you've curled all of your hair, use a light hairspray to hold your curls in place without weighing them down.</p><h2 id="stepbystep">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed look at each step:</p><h3>1.
