Hair grows in three stages: the anagen phase, the catagen phase, and the telogen phase. The anagen phase is the active growth phase, where the hair follicle is producing new hair. The catagen phase is the transitional phase, where the hair follicle starts to shrink. The telogen phase is the resting phase, where the hair follicle remains dormant until the cycle starts again.</p><p>To promote faster hair growth, it is important to provide the hair follicles with the necessary nutrients and vitamins. The following ingredients are known to stimulate hair growth:</p><ul><li>Biotin</li><li>Vitamin C</li><li>Vitamin E</li><li>Vitamin A</li><li>Iron</li></ul><p>These ingredients can be found in various foods such as eggs, spinach, sweet potatoes, and avocados.

Some people may naturally have slower hair growth than others.</p><h3>Q: How long does it take to see results?</h3><p>A: It can take several months to see noticeable results.
