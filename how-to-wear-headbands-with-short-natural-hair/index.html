Here are a few of our favorites:</p><h3>1. Wear it as a Statement Piece</h3><p>If you have a bold and colorful headband, wear it as a statement piece. This means that you should keep the rest of your hair and outfit simple. This will help to draw attention to your headband and make it stand out.</p><h3>2. Wear it with a Low Bun</h3><p>If you have short natural hair, you can still wear a low bun. Simply gather your hair at the nape of your neck and secure it with an elastic band. Then, place your headband over your head and push it down to your forehead.</p><h3>3. Wear it with a High Bun</h3><p>If you have enough hair to make a high bun, you can wear a headband with it. Simply gather your hair at the top of your head and secure it with an elastic band. Then, place your headband over your head and push it down to your forehead.</p><h3>4. Wear it with a Twist-Out</h3><p>If you have a twist-out or braid-out, you can still wear a headband. Simply place the headband over your hairline and push it down to your forehead. This will help to keep your hair out of your face and add some style to your look.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to wear headbands with short natural hair:</p><ol><li>Choose your headband.
