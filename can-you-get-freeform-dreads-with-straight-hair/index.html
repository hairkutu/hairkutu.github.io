Read on for more information.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Freeform dreads are a natural, organic style of dreadlocks that form on their own without the use of specific methods or techniques. They are generally smaller in size, and each dreadlock is unique in shape and size. This style is popular among people with various hair textures, including straight hair.</p><h2>How to Get Freeform Dreads with Straight Hair</h2><p>To achieve freeform dreads with straight hair, you will need to follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Stop using hair products</h3><p>Stop using hair products such as shampoo, conditioner, and hair gel.

You can use your fingers to separate any knots that form to prevent matting.</p><h3>Step 3: Be patient</h3><p>Freeform dreads take time to form, and it can take several months or even years for the hair to lock up completely.

You can make your own sea salt spray by mixing water and sea salt in a spray bottle.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Can you get freeform dreads with short hair?</h3><p>Yes, you can get freeform dreads with short hair. However, it may take longer for them to form since there is less hair to lock up.</p><h3>Can you wash freeform dreads?</h3><p>Yes, you can wash freeform dreads.
