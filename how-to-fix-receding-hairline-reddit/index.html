It typically begins at the temples and gradually moves back, creating an "M" shape. This condition is often caused by genetics, but it can also be triggered by stress, hormonal changes, and certain medications.

It works by increasing blood flow to the hair follicles, promoting hair growth. You can buy minoxidil over the counter, and it's available in various forms, such as foam, liquid, and spray. Apply minoxidil twice a day to the affected area and massage it into your scalp. It may take several months to see visible results, so be patient.</p><h3>2. Try Finasteride</h3><p>Finasteride is a prescription medication that's used to treat male pattern baldness. It works by blocking the hormone that causes hair loss, preventing further hair loss and promoting hair growth. Finasteride is available in pill form, and you'll need a prescription from your doctor to get it. However, it may have side effects, such as decreased sex drive and erectile dysfunction, so talk to your doctor before taking it.</p><h3>3.

It's a permanent solution for hair loss, and it can give you a natural-looking hairline. However, it's an expensive procedure, and it may take several months to see visible results.
