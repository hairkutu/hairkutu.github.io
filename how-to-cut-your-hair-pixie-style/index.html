Pixie cuts are short, low-maintenance hairstyles that can give you a fresh new look. Here's a step by step guide on how to cut your hair pixie style.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>A pixie cut is a short hairstyle that's typically cut above the ears and close to the head.

You can always cut more hair off, but you can't add it back once it's gone.</li><li>Take your time and cut small sections of hair at a time.
