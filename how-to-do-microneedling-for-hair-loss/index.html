Microneedling has been used for many years to improve the appearance of acne scars, fine lines, and wrinkles. Recently, microneedling has gained popularity as a treatment for hair loss. Microneedling for hair loss involves creating small punctures in the scalp to stimulate hair growth.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to do Microneedling for Hair Loss</h2><p>Microneedling for hair loss is a simple procedure that can be done at home or in a clinic. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Clean your scalp</h3><p>Before microneedling, it is essential to clean your scalp thoroughly. Use a gentle shampoo and warm water to remove any dirt or oil on your scalp. Dry your hair using a clean towel or a hairdryer.</p><h3>Step 2: Prepare the microneedling device</h3><p>Choose a microneedling device with needles that are at least 0.5mm long. Sterilize the device by soaking it in alcohol for a few minutes. Once the device is sterilized, you can start microneedling.</p><h3>Step 3: Microneedle your scalp</h3><p>Start microneedling your scalp by dividing your hair into several sections. Use the microneedling device to make small punctures on your scalp, focusing on the areas where you experience hair loss. Be gentle and avoid applying too much pressure, as this can cause pain or bleeding. </p><h3>Step 4: Apply hair growth serum</h3><p>Once you have microneedled your scalp, apply a hair growth serum to the affected areas.
