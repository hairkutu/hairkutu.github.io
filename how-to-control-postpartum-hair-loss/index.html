During pregnancy, many women experience thicker and fuller hair due to hormonal changes. However, after giving birth, hormone levels drop, and this can cause hair to fall out in large amounts. If you’re struggling with postpartum hair loss, don’t worry, there are ways to manage it. In this article, we’ll be providing you with some tips and tricks on how to control postpartum hair loss.</p><h2>How to Control Postpartum Hair Loss</h2><p>Postpartum hair loss can be distressing, but there are things you can do to control it.

Biotin, iron, and folic acid are some of the supplements that can help with hair growth.</p><h3>3. Avoid Tight Hairstyles</h3><p>Avoid tight hairstyles that can pull on your hair and cause breakage.

Trim Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Trimming your hair regularly can help get rid of split ends and prevent breakage.</p><h3>3. Don’t Brush Wet Hair</h3><p>Don’t brush wet hair as it’s more prone to breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair gently.</p><h3>4. Protect Your Hair While Sleeping</h3><p>Protect your hair while sleeping by using a silk or satin pillowcase. This will prevent damage and breakage to your hair.</p><h3>5. Be Gentle When Styling Your Hair</h3><p>Be gentle when styling your hair and avoid pulling or tugging on your hair.
