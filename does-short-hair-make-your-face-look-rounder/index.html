However, one of the most common myths regarding short hair is that it makes your face look rounder. This belief has been around for a long time, but is it true? In this article, we'll explore whether short hair makes your face look rounder or not.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>The belief that short hair makes your face look rounder is not entirely true. While it may seem like short hair accentuates the roundness of your face, it actually depends on the cut and style of the hair. If the cut and style are not suitable for your face shape, it can make your face look rounder. However, with the right cut and style, short hair can actually make your face look slimmer and more defined.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>The first step in determining whether short hair will make your face look rounder is to identify your face shape. There are six basic face shapes: oval, square, round, heart, oblong, and diamond. Once you know your face shape, you can choose a suitable short hairstyle that flatters your features.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Round Faces</h3><p>If you have a round face, it's best to choose a short hairstyle that adds height to your hair and elongates your face. A pixie cut with long bangs swept to the side or a layered bob with volume at the crown can help slim down your face. Avoid blunt cuts that end at the chin as they can make your face look wider.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Oval Faces</h3><p>Oval faces are considered the most balanced face shape, and almost any short hairstyle can suit this face shape. However, to highlight your features, you can try a cropped pixie cut or a bob with choppy layers.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Square Faces</h3><p>Square faces have a strong jawline and wide forehead. To soften the angles, you can opt for a short hairstyle that adds volume to the crown, such as a textured pixie cut or a wavy bob.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Heart-Shaped Faces</h3><p>Heart-shaped faces have a wide forehead and narrow jawline. A short hairstyle that adds volume to the chin area, such as a layered bob or a pixie cut with side-swept bangs, can balance out your features.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Oblong Faces</h3><p>Oblong faces are longer than they are wide, with a prominent forehead and chin. To make your face look wider, you can try a short hairstyle with volume at the sides, such as a curly bob or a pixie cut with textured layers.</p><h3>Short Hairstyles for Diamond Faces</h3><p>Diamond faces have a narrow forehead and chin, with wide cheekbones. A short hairstyle that adds volume at the crown, such as a textured pixie cut or a layered bob, can complement your features.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step by step</h2><p>Here are some steps to follow when choosing a short hairstyle that flatters your face shape:</p><ol><li>Identify your face shape</li><li>Research short hairstyles that suit your face shape</li><li>Consult with a hairstylist to determine the best cut and style for your face shape</li><li>Maintain your short hairstyle with regular trims and styling</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind when choosing a short hairstyle:</p><ul><li>Consider your hair texture and thickness when choosing a short hairstyle</li><li>Experiment with different hairstyles to find the one that flatters your face shape best</li><li>Choose a hairstyle that complements your personal style and personality</li><li>Accessorize your short hairstyle with headbands, clips, and other hair accessories</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><h3>Does short hair suit round faces?</h3><p>Yes, short hair can suit round faces if the cut and style are suitable for the face shape.

However, it's important to keep your hair healthy and nourished with regular washing, conditioning, and styling.
