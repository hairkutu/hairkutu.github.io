Curly hair requires more moisture than straight hair, so using products that are specifically formulated for curly hair will help keep your hair healthy and hydrated.</p><h4>Q: How often should I wash my thick curly hair?</h4><p>A: It depends on your hair type and lifestyle, but most people with thick curly hair can go 2-3 days between washes. Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, which can cause it to become dry and brittle.</p><h4>Q: Can I use the same shampoo and conditioner for my curly hair and my extensions?</h4><p>A: It's best to use different products for your natural hair and your extensions. Extensions require different care than your natural hair, so using the same products on both can cause damage to your natural hair and your extensions.</p><p>We hope this article has been helpful in your search for the best shampoo and conditioner for thick curly hair.
