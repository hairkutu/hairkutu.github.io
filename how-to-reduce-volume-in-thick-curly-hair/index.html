While some people love the volume, others want to reduce it for a more manageable and sleek look. In this blog post, we will discuss how to reduce volume in thick curly hair and provide you with useful tips and tricks to make your hair more manageable.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ol><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>Thick curly hair tends to have a lot of volume due to the natural shape of the curls. This can make it difficult to manage and style, especially if you prefer a more sleek and polished look. However, there are several ways to reduce volume in thick curly hair without damaging or altering the natural texture of your hair.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>Here are some ways to reduce volume in thick curly hair:</p><h3>1. Use a Diffuser</h3><p>A diffuser attachment on your hair dryer can help to evenly distribute heat and reduce frizz, which can contribute to volume. Use the diffuser on a low heat setting and scrunch your hair as you dry it to encourage your curls to form without adding too much volume.</p><h3>2. Try a Hair Serum</h3><p>A hair serum can help to tame frizz and add shine to your hair, while also reducing volume. Apply a small amount of serum to your hair, focusing on the ends and mid-lengths, and avoid applying it to the roots.</p><h3>3. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Using a wide-tooth comb instead of a brush can help to detangle your hair without creating too much volume. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots, gently combing through any tangles.</p><h3>4. Cut Your Hair in Layers</h3><p>Layered haircuts can help to reduce volume in thick curly hair by removing some of the bulk. Ask your hairstylist for long layers that will help to frame your face and reduce volume without sacrificing length.</p><h3>5. Avoid Heavy Products</h3><p>Heavy styling products can weigh down your hair and contribute to volume.
