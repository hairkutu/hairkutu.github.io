The type of curl you have is determined by the shape of your hair follicle. There are generally four types of curly hair:</p><ul><li>Type 2: Wavy Hair</li><li>Type 3: Curly Hair</li><li>Type 4: Coily Hair</li><li>Type 5: Kinky Hair</li></ul><p>Each type has its own unique characteristics and requires different care.
