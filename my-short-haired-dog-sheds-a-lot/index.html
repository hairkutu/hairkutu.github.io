While all dogs shed, some breeds shed more than others. My short haired dog sheds a lot and it can be frustrating to deal with the constant shedding. But don't worry, there are several things you can do to manage your dog's shedding and keep your home clean and free of dog hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Short haired dogs are known for their sleek and shiny coats. They are easy to groom and require minimal maintenance. However, they can also shed a lot, especially during the shedding season which can be twice a year.
