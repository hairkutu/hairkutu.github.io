With so many options available in the market, it can be challenging to find the best pomade for slicked back hair in the UK. That’s why we’ve put together this comprehensive guide to help you find the perfect product for your hair type and styling needs. In this article, we’ll cover everything from how to choose the right pomade to step-by-step instructions on how to create the perfect slicked back hairstyle.</p><h2>Description: What is Slicked Back Hair?</h2><p>Slicked back hair is a classic hairstyle that has been popular for decades. It is characterized by hair that is combed back and styled with a product to create a smooth, sleek look. This hairstyle can be achieved with a variety of products, including pomade, gel, wax, and hairspray. However, pomade is the most popular choice for achieving a slicked back hairstyle.</p><h2>How to Choose the Right Pomade for Slicked Back Hair</h2><p>Choosing the right pomade for your hair type and styling needs is essential for achieving the perfect slicked back hairstyle. Here are some factors to consider when selecting a pomade:</p><h3>Hold:</h3><p>The hold of the pomade refers to its ability to keep your hair in place. If you have thick, coarse hair, you will need a pomade with a strong hold to keep your hair in place. On the other hand, if you have fine or thin hair, a light hold pomade would be a better option.</p><h3>Shine:</h3><p>The shine of the pomade refers to the amount of gloss or sheen it adds to your hair. If you want a high-shine look, choose a pomade with a high shine. However, if you prefer a more natural-looking finish, opt for a matte pomade.</p><h3>Texture:</h3><p>The texture of the pomade refers to how it feels in your hair. Some pomades are smooth and creamy, while others are thicker and waxier. Choose a texture that works well with your hair type and the style you want to achieve.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Creating the Perfect Slicked Back Hairstyle</h2><p>Now that you’ve chosen the right pomade for your hair, it’s time to create the perfect slicked back hairstyle. Here’s how to do it:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and drying your hair. This will ensure that your hair is clean and free of any product buildup.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Pomade</h3><p>Take a small amount of pomade and rub it between your palms to warm it up. Then, apply the pomade to your hair, starting at the back and working your way forward. Make sure to distribute the pomade evenly throughout your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb Your Hair Back</h3><p>Using a fine-toothed comb, comb your hair back, starting at the hairline and working your way back to the crown of your head. Make sure to comb your hair in the direction you want it to go.</p><h3>Step 4: Smooth Your Hair</h3><p>Using your hands, smooth your hair back to create a sleek, polished look. Make sure to remove any bumps or tangles.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finish your look with a light mist of hairspray to hold your hair in place. This will ensure that your hairstyle stays put throughout the day.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Your Slicked Back Hairstyle</h2><p>To keep your slicked back hairstyle looking its best, here are some tips to keep in mind:</p><h3>Tip 1: Avoid Overusing Product</h3><p>Using too much product can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. Use a small amount of pomade and hairspray to avoid this problem.</p><h3>Tip 2: Don’t Touch Your Hair Too Much</h3><p>Touching your hair too much can cause it to lose its shape and become messy. Avoid touching your hair as much as possible to maintain your hairstyle.</p><h3>Tip 3: Wash Your Hair Regularly</h3><p>Washing your hair regularly will help remove any product buildup and keep your hair looking clean and healthy.</p><h2>FAQs About Slicked Back Hair and Pomade</h2><h3>Q: Can I Achieve a Slicked Back Hairstyle with Gel?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can achieve a slicked back hairstyle with gel, but pomade is the better option. Gel tends to be more drying and can leave your hair looking crunchy and stiff.</p><h3>Q: Can I Use Pomade on Fine Hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can use pomade on fine hair, but choose a light hold pomade to avoid weighing down your hair.</p><h3>Q: How Do I Remove Pomade from My Hair?</h3><p>A: To remove pomade from your hair, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo. This will help remove any buildup and leave your hair looking clean and healthy.</p><h2>Hair Care for Slicked Back Hair</h2><p>To keep your hair looking its best, it’s essential to take care of it. Here are some tips for maintaining healthy, shiny hair:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use a Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>Using a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner will help keep your hair hydrated and healthy.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Using Hot Tools Too Often</h3><p>Using hot tools too often can damage your hair and make it look dry and brittle. Avoid using them as much as possible, and always use a heat protectant spray.</p><h3>Tip 3: Get Regular Trims</h3><p>Getting regular trims will help keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>With the right pomade and styling techniques, achieving the perfect slicked back hairstyle is easy. Follow the tips and tricks outlined in this article to achieve a sleek, polished look that will turn heads.</p></article>
