If you must use them, make sure to use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage.</p><h3>3. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet can help promote hair growth and thickness. Make sure to eat plenty of protein, which is essential for healthy hair. Other important nutrients for hair health include vitamins A, C, and E, as well as biotin and iron.</p><h3>4.
