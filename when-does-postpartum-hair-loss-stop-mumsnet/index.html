As much as 50% of women experience hair loss after giving birth, and it can be a distressing experience for some. However, the good news is that postpartum hair loss is not permanent and usually stops on its own. In this article, we will discuss when postpartum hair loss stops according to Mumsnet, as well as tips on how to cope with it.</p><h2>What Causes Postpartum Hair Loss?</h2><p>During pregnancy, the hormone levels in a woman's body change, which can cause the hair to grow thicker and fuller. However, after giving birth, the hormone levels return to normal, and the hair enters a resting phase. This resting phase can last for several weeks or months, after which the hair falls out. This shedding is called postpartum hair loss or telogen effluvium.</p><h2>When Does Postpartum Hair Loss Start and Stop?</h2><p>Postpartum hair loss usually starts around three months after giving birth, but it can start earlier or later. The shedding can last for several months, and most women see their hair return to its pre-pregnancy state within six to twelve months after giving birth. However, some women may experience more prolonged hair loss or shedding that lasts for up to two years.</p><h2>How to Cope with Postpartum Hair Loss?</h2><p>While postpartum hair loss can be distressing, there are ways to cope with it. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Be Gentle with Your Hair</h3><p>Avoid using harsh chemicals on your hair, such as dyes and perms. Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner and avoid heat styling tools like straighteners and curling irons. You can air-dry your hair or use a low heat setting on your hairdryer.</p><h3>2. Eat a Healthy Diet</h3><p>Eating a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals can help promote hair growth. Foods that are good for hair health include salmon, eggs, spinach, and avocados.</p><h3>3. Get Enough Sleep</h3><p>Lack of sleep can contribute to hair loss, so it's essential to get enough rest. Try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep every night.</p><h3>4. Consider a New Hairstyle</h3><p>If you're struggling with postpartum hair loss, consider a new hairstyle that works with your hair's new texture and volume.</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1. Is postpartum hair loss normal?</h3><p>Yes, postpartum hair loss is a normal experience for many women.</p><h3>2. How long does postpartum hair loss last?</h3><p>Postpartum hair loss can last for several months, but most women see their hair return to its pre-pregnancy state within six to twelve months.</p><h3>3. Can postpartum hair loss be prevented?</h3><p>Postpartum hair loss cannot be prevented, but you can take steps to minimize it and promote hair growth.</p><h2>Hair Care Tips for Postpartum Hair Loss</h2><p>Here are some additional hair care tips to help you cope with postpartum hair loss:</p><h3>1. Massage Your Scalp</h3><p>Massaging your scalp can help stimulate hair growth. Use your fingertips to massage your scalp gently for a few minutes every day.</p><h3>2. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Avoid using a brush on your hair, as it can cause breakage. Instead, use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair gently.</p><h3>3. Try Hair Supplements</h3><p>There are many hair supplements available that can promote hair growth. Look for supplements that contain biotin, zinc, and iron.</p><h3>4. Be Patient</h3><p>Remember, postpartum hair loss is temporary, and your hair will eventually return to its pre-pregnancy state. Be patient and take care of your hair, and it will grow back.</p><p>In conclusion, postpartum hair loss is a common experience among new mothers, but it is not permanent. The shedding usually stops on its own within six to twelve months after giving birth. In the meantime, taking care of your hair and practicing self-care can help you cope with the experience.</p></article>
