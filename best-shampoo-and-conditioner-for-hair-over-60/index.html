If you have fine, thinning hair, look for products that add volume and thickness. If you have thick, curly hair, look for products that define and hydrate your curls.</p><h3>Read Reviews</h3><p>Reading reviews from other women over 60 can be a great way to find the right shampoo and conditioner for your hair.
