You will need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water.

Start by parting your hair down the middle and then divide each side into two or three sections. Use hair clips to secure each section.</p><h3>Step 3: Start cutting</h3><p>Start with the back of your head and work your way to the front. Use your comb to pull each section of hair straight and then cut the ends with your scissors. Make sure to cut small amounts at a time and keep checking to make sure the length is even.</p><h3>Step 4: Trim the sides and front</h3><p>Once you have finished cutting the back, move on to the sides and front. Use your comb to lift each section of hair and then trim the ends with your scissors.
