Make sure your fingers are parallel to the floor.</li><li>Cut the hair just below your fingers, using sharp scissors. Be careful not to cut too much off at once – it's better to take small snips and check your progress as you go.</li><li>Repeat this process with small sections of hair around your head, moving from the front of your head to the back. Make sure each section is the same length as the one before it.</li><li>Now it's time to add layers.

If you do decide to cut your hair when it's wet, make sure you're aware of this and adjust your cutting accordingly.</p><h3>How often should I cut my curly hair?</h3><p>This depends on your hair type and how quickly it grows. In general, we recommend getting a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><h3>What if I mess up my hair?</h3><p>Don't panic! If you make a mistake, you can always visit a professional stylist to fix it.

Here are some tips for keeping your curly hair healthy and beautiful:</p><ul><li>Use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner to avoid stripping your hair of its natural oils.</li><li>Avoid using heat tools on your hair, as this can cause damage and frizz.</li><li>Invest in a good leave-in conditioner to help keep your curls hydrated and defined.</li><li>Sleep on a silk or satin pillowcase to help prevent frizz and breakage.</li><li>Avoid brushing your hair when it's dry, as this can cause breakage and frizz.
