Comb your hair thoroughly to remove any tangles or knots.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections. You can use clips or hair ties to separate your hair into top, sides, and back sections.</li><li>Start with the back section. Use a mirror to see the back of your head and hold the scissors at a slight angle to cut your hair in a straight line. Cut small sections at a time, and be careful not to cut too much at once.</li><li>Move to the side sections. Use the same technique as the back section, cutting in a straight line from the bottom to the top. Be sure to blend the hair with the back section so that there are no visible lines.</li><li>Finally, move to the top section. You can use scissors or clippers to trim the hair on top. Be sure to blend the hair with the sides and back sections so that it looks even.</li><li>Check your work. Use a mirror to check the back of your head and make any necessary adjustments.

You can always cut more, but you can't put hair back once it's been cut.</li><li>Use a comb to guide your scissors. This will help you achieve a straight, even cut.</li><li>Don't rush.
