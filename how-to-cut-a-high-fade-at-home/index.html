The top hair can be left longer or cut to the same length as the sides. Here are the basic steps for cutting a high fade at home:</p><h3>1. Gather the Right Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have the necessary tools. You will need:</p><ul><li>Clippers with different guard sizes</li><li>Scissors</li><li>Comb</li><li>Clip or hair tie</li><li>Mirror</li></ul><h3>2. Decide on the Length and Style</h3><p>Decide on the length and style you want for the top of your head. You can leave the top hair longer, or you can cut it to the same length as the sides. You can also choose to style the top hair in a particular way, such as a pompadour or quiff.</p><h3>3. Cut the Top Hair</h3><p>If you're leaving the top hair longer, comb it and cut it to the desired length. If you're cutting it to the same length as the sides, use a clip or hair tie to separate the top hair from the sides.</p><h3>4. Cut the Sides and Back</h3><p>Start with the longest guard size and cut the hair on the sides and back of the head. Gradually switch to shorter guard sizes to create a tapered effect. Use scissors to trim any longer hairs that weren't cut by the clippers.</p><h3>5.

Use scissors to blend any uneven areas.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed step-by-step guide on how to cut a high fade at home:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair and towel-drying it.
