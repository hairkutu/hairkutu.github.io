This length is usually achieved using a clipper guard number 3, hence the name "3 haircut." It's a popular choice for those who want a relatively short haircut without going too extreme. This length is perfect for those who want to maintain a bit of length while still keeping their hair short and manageable.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to</h2><p>If you're looking to get a 3 haircut, it's best to go to a professional barber or hairstylist.
