It is caused by the hair cuticle becoming raised, which leads to a lack of moisture and an increase in static. This can be due to genetics, hair damage, or environmental factors such as humidity. People with curly or wavy hair are more prone to frizz, as their hair cuticles are naturally more raised than those with straight hair.</p><!--How to Embrace Your Frizzy Hair--><h2>How to Embrace Your Frizzy Hair</h2><p id="how-to">Embracing your frizzy hair can be a difficult journey, but it's important to remember that your hair is unique and beautiful in its own way. Here are some tips on how to embrace your frizzy hair:</p><ul><li>Experiment with different hairstyles that complement your hair's natural texture.</li><li>Invest in hair products that are specifically designed for frizzy hair, such as smoothing serums and leave-in conditioners.</li><li>Avoid over-styling your hair with heat tools, as this can lead to further damage and frizz.</li><li>Be patient and kind to your hair.
