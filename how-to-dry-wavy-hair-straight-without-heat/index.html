Heat can cause damage to your hair and make it look dull and lifeless. Fortunately, there are alternative methods to dry your hair straight without using heat. In this blog post, we will share some tips and tricks on how to dry wavy hair straight without heat. </p><h2> How to Dry Wavy Hair Straight Without Heat </h2><p>Here are some effective ways to dry wavy hair straight without using heat:</p><h3> 1. Air Dry </h3><p>Air drying is the easiest and most natural way to dry your hair straight. After washing your hair, gently squeeze out the excess water and use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. Then, divide your hair into sections and twist them tightly. Leave your hair to air dry overnight or until it is completely dry. When you untwist your hair, you will have straight, sleek locks. </p><h3> 2. Blow Dry with Cold Air </h3><p>If you need to dry your hair quickly, you can use a blow dryer on the cool setting. Start by towel-drying your hair and then use a wide-tooth comb to detangle it. Then, divide your hair into sections and use the cool air setting on your blow dryer to dry each section. Make sure to hold the blow dryer at least six inches away from your hair to avoid heat damage. </p><h3> 3.
