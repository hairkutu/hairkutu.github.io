Whether you’re a natural blonde or you’re thinking about going blonde, this is a color that is sure to turn heads.</p><p>When it comes to shades of blonde, guys tend to prefer lighter shades like platinum or honey blonde. These shades can make you look more youthful and can help to brighten up your features. However, if you have darker skin or features, a darker shade of blonde like ash blonde might be more flattering.</p><h2 id="brunette-hair">Brunette Hair</h2><p>Brunette hair is another classic look that has been popular with guys for years. Whether you’re a natural brunette or you’re thinking about going darker, this is a color that is always in style.</p><p>When it comes to shades of brown, guys tend to prefer warmer, richer shades like chestnut or chocolate brown.
