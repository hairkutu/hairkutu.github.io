This is a common problem that many people face, and it can be frustrating to deal with. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind this phenomenon and provide some tips on how to manage it.</p><h2>Table of Content</h2><ul><li><a href="#reasons">Reasons Why Hair is Curly Underneath But Not On Top</a></li><li><a href="#howto">How to Manage Curly Hair Underneath</a></li><li><a href="#steps">Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Curly Hair Underneath</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Managing Curly Hair Underneath</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs About Curly Hair Underneath</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care for Curly Hair</a></li></ul><h2 id="reasons">Reasons Why Hair is Curly Underneath But Not On Top</h2><p>There are several reasons why hair can be curly underneath but not on top:</p><h3>1. Genetics</h3><p>Genetics plays a significant role in determining hair type, texture, and curl pattern. If your parents or grandparents have curly hair, there is a high chance that you will have curly hair as well. However, the curl pattern may not be the same all over your head, which can explain why your hair is curly underneath but not on top.</p><h3>2. Hair Length</h3><p>The length of your hair can also influence its curl pattern. Hair that is shorter tends to be curlier because the curls have less weight to pull them down. On the other hand, longer hair may be straighter on top because the curls have more weight to pull them down, resulting in less volume and curl.</p><h3>3. Hair Care Products</h3><p>The type of hair care products you use can also affect your hair's curl pattern. If you use products that are too heavy or contain ingredients that weigh down your hair, it can result in straighter hair on top and curlier hair underneath.</p><h3>4. Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can also affect your hair's curl pattern. If you use heat tools such as flat irons or curling irons on a regular basis, it can cause damage to your hair, resulting in straighter hair on top and curlier hair underneath.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Manage Curly Hair Underneath</h2><p>Managing curly hair underneath can be challenging, but there are several things you can do to make it more manageable:</p><h3>1. Use the Right Hair Products</h3><p>Using the right hair products is essential for managing curly hair. Look for products that are specifically designed for curly hair, such as curl defining cream or mousse. These products can help enhance your curls and reduce frizz.</p><h3>2. Detangle Your Hair Gently</h3><p>When detangling your hair, be gentle and use a wide-tooth comb or your fingers. Avoid using a brush, as it can cause breakage and damage to your hair. Start at the ends of your hair and work your way up to the roots, using a detangling spray if necessary.</p><h3>3. Style Your Hair When Wet</h3><p>Curly hair is easier to style when it's wet, so try to style your hair after washing it. Apply your hair products to damp hair and scrunch your hair upward to enhance your curls.</p><h2 id="steps">Step-by-Step Guide to Styling Curly Hair Underneath</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to styling curly hair underneath:</p><h3>Step 1:</h3><p>Wash your hair with a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner that is designed for curly hair.</p><h3>Step 2:</h3><p>Apply a curl defining cream or mousse to your damp hair and distribute it evenly with your fingers.</p><h3>Step 3:</h3><p>Scrunch your hair upward to enhance your curls and reduce frizz.</p><h3>Step 4:</h3><p>Use a diffuser attachment on your blow dryer and dry your hair on a low heat setting. Alternatively, let your hair air dry.</p><h3>Step 5:</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, use a small amount of hair oil or serum to add shine and reduce frizz.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Managing Curly Hair Underneath</h2><p>Here are some additional tips for managing curly hair underneath:</p><h3>1.

Can I Straighten My Hair on Top?</h3><p>Yes, you can straighten your hair on top if you prefer a straighter look. However, be sure to use a heat protectant spray and avoid using heat styling tools on a daily basis, as this can cause damage to your hair.</p><h3>2.

However, be sure to go to a professional stylist who specializes in curly hair to avoid damage to your hair.</p><h2 id="haircare">Hair Care for Curly Hair</h2><p>Here are some general tips for hair care for curly hair:</p><h3>1. Use Sulfate-Free Shampoo and Conditioner</h3><p>Sulfates can strip your hair of its natural oils, making it dry and brittle. Look for shampoo and conditioner that are sulfate-free and designed for curly hair.</p><h3>2. Deep Condition Regularly</h3><p>Deep conditioning can help nourish your hair and keep it hydrated. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week, leaving it on for at least 20 minutes before rinsing it off.</p><h3>3.

If you must use heat styling tools, be sure to use a heat protectant spray and avoid using them on a daily basis.</p><p>In conclusion, having curly hair underneath but not on top is a common problem that many people face.
