Fading the hair involves tapering the hair length gradually from the top of the head towards the sides and back. It gives a clean and sharp look that suits any face shape. In this article, we'll guide you through the process of how to fade men's hair with scissors.</p><h2>How to Fade Men's Hair with Scissors - Step by Step Guide</h2><p>Before we begin, you'll need a pair of good quality hair cutting scissors, a comb, and a mirror. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Fading Length</h3><p>The first step is to decide on the length of the fade. You can choose from high, mid, or low fade. High fade means the hair is faded almost to the scalp, mid fade means the hair is faded halfway, and low fade means the hair is faded just above the ears.</p><h3>Step 2: Cut the Top Hair</h3><p>Start by cutting the top hair to the desired length. Use the scissors to cut the hair in a vertical direction, holding the hair between your fingers and cutting a little at a time. Make sure to blend the hair in with the faded sides and back.</p><h3>Step 3: Start Fading the Sides and Back</h3><p>Use the comb to separate the hair on the sides and back from the top hair. Start fading the hair by cutting the hair at the desired length and blend it in with the top hair. Cut a little at a time and use the comb to check the length and blend.</p><h3>Step 4: Create a Defined Line</h3><p>Once you've faded the hair to the desired length, create a defined line between the faded hair and the longer hair on top. Use your scissors to create a straight line and blend the hair in with the faded hair.</p><h3>Step 5: Check for Evenness</h3><p>Check the hair for evenness by using a mirror. Look at the hair from all angles and make sure it's blended and faded evenly. If you notice any unevenness, go back and blend the hair in.</p><h2>Tips for Fading Men's Hair with Scissors</h2><p>Here are some tips to keep in mind while fading men's hair with scissors:</p><ul><li>Use sharp scissors for a clean cut.</li><li>Work on one side at a time to ensure evenness.</li><li>Blend the hair in slowly and gradually.</li><li>Use a mirror to check for evenness.</li><li>Take your time and don't rush the process.</li></ul><h2>FAQ - How to Fade Men's Hair with Scissors</h2><h3>What is a faded haircut?</h3><p>A faded haircut involves tapering the hair length gradually from the top of the head towards the sides and back.
