However, one of the most frustrating things about braids is when the hair starts to come out of them. This can happen for a variety of reasons, including improper braiding techniques, using the wrong type of hair, or simply due to normal wear and tear. In this article, we will discuss how to fix hair coming out of braids and provide some tips and tricks to ensure your braids last as long as possible.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>There are a few different methods you can use to fix hair coming out of braids.

Then, take a small amount of hair from the section and add it to the adjacent braid. Repeat this process until you have re-braided the entire section of loose hair.</p><h3>Method 2: Use Hair Ties</h3><p>If you have a larger section of hair coming out of your braids, you can use hair ties to secure it back in place. Start by gathering the loose hair together and twisting it tightly. Then, wrap a hair tie around the twisted section of hair to hold it in place. You can also use bobby pins to secure the hair tie in place.</p><h3>Method 3: Use a Hot Tool</h3><p>If you have a lot of loose hair coming out of your braids, you can use a hot tool, such as a flat iron or curling iron, to help secure it back in place. Start by twisting the loose hair tightly and then run the hot tool over the twisted section.
