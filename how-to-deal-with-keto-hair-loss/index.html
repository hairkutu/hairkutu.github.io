It has been shown to be effective in weight loss, improving blood sugar control, and reducing inflammation. However, one of the side effects of the keto diet is hair loss. This can be a concern for many people, but it is important to remember that it is usually temporary and can be managed.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Deal with Keto Hair Loss</h2><p>The first step in dealing with keto hair loss is to understand why it happens.

However, this change in metabolism can cause a temporary hair loss, which is known as telogen effluvium.</p><p>To deal with keto hair loss, you need to ensure that you are getting enough nutrients. This means eating a well-balanced diet that includes plenty of protein, vitamins, and minerals.
