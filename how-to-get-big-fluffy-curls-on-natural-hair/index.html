All it takes is a few simple techniques and the right products. Here are the steps:</p><h3>1. Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This will help to keep your hair hydrated and healthy, which is essential for achieving big fluffy curls. Rinse your hair thoroughly and blot it dry with a towel.</p><h3>2. Apply a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>Next, apply a leave-in conditioner to your hair. This will help to smooth out any tangles and prepare your hair for styling. Be sure to apply the conditioner evenly throughout your hair, from roots to ends.</p><h3>3. Use a Curl Enhancing Cream</h3><p>Apply a curl enhancing cream to your hair, focusing on the ends. This will help to define your curls and give them more bounce. Be sure to use a cream that is specifically designed for curly hair, as this will give you the best results.</p><h3>4. Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair into small sections using clips or hair ties. This will make it easier to work with and ensure that you don't miss any sections.</p><h3>5. Use a Diffuser</h3><p>Attach a diffuser to your hair dryer and set it to low heat. This will help to distribute the heat evenly and prevent your hair from becoming too dry. Start at the roots and work your way down to the ends, scrunching your hair as you go.</p><h3>6. Finish with a Hair Spray</h3><p>Once you've finished diffusing your hair, finish with a hair spray to set your curls in place. Be sure to use a spray that is designed for curly hair, as this will help to hold your curls without making them feel stiff or crunchy.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Here is a step-by-step guide to help you get big fluffy curls on natural hair:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair</li><li>Apply a leave-in conditioner</li><li>Use a curl enhancing cream</li><li>Section your hair</li><li>Use a diffuser</li><li>Finish with a hair spray</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Perfect Curls</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you achieve perfect, big fluffy curls:</p><ul><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair before styling</li><li>Avoid using too much heat, as this can damage your hair and make your curls look frizzy</li><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent your hair from becoming tangled while you sleep</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much, as this can cause frizz and disrupt your curls</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and hydrated</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about getting big fluffy curls on natural hair:</p><h3>Q: How often should I wash my hair?</h3><p>A: It's best to wash your hair once or twice a week, depending on your hair type and how oily it gets.
