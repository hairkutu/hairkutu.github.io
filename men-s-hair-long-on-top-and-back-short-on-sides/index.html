This timeless style has been popular for decades and continues to be a go-to look for many men. In this guide, we'll go over everything you need to know about this style, from how to ask for it at the barber shop to how to care for your hair at home.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The long on top and back short on sides style is characterized by longer hair on the top and back of the head, with shorter hair on the sides and back. This creates a contrast in length that is both stylish and practical. The longer hair on top can be styled in a variety of ways, from slicked back to messy, while the shorter sides and back make for a low-maintenance look that requires minimal styling.</p><h2>How to Ask for it</h2><p>When you go to the barber shop, it's important to know how to ask for the long on top and back short on sides style. Here's what to tell your barber:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Length</h3><p>Start by deciding how long you want your hair to be on top. This can vary depending on your personal preference and face shape, so take some time to consider what will look best on you. Once you've decided on a length, tell your barber exactly how many inches you want to leave on top.</p><h3>Step 2: Decide on Your Fade</h3><p>The short sides and back of this style are achieved with a fade, which gradually tapers the hair from longer on top to shorter on the sides and back. There are several types of fades to choose from, including a high fade, mid fade, and low fade. Decide which type of fade you prefer and let your barber know.</p><h3>Step 3: Choose Your Styling</h3><p>Finally, decide on how you want to style your longer hair on top. This can include anything from a classic side part to a messy, textured style. Work with your barber to determine what will look best with your hair type and face shape.</p><h2>Step-by-Step Guide: How to Style Long on Top and Back Short on Sides Hair</h2><p>Once you've got your long on top and back short on sides cut, it's time to learn how to style it. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieving the perfect look:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing and conditioning your hair with products that are suited to your hair type. This will help to keep your hair healthy and make it easier to style.</p><h3>Step 2: Towel Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Use a towel to gently dry your hair, leaving it slightly damp. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously with the towel, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product to your hair, focusing on the longer hair on top. This can include anything from a pomade to a styling cream or gel.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>Using your fingers or a comb, style your longer hair on top into your desired look. This can include anything from a slicked-back style to a messy, textured look.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with Hairspray</h3><p>Finally, finish off your look with a light mist of hairspray to help hold your style in place throughout the day.</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Long on Top and Back Short on Sides Hair</h2><p>Once you've got your long on top and back short on sides cut, it's important to take care of your hair to keep it looking great.
