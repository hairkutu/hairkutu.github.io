Here are some steps to get you started:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather Your Tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting, make sure you have all the tools you need. You will need a pair of sharp scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water.</p><h3>Step 2: Wet the Hair</h3><p>Spray the back of your toddler’s head with water to make the hair easier to work with. Make sure the hair is damp but not soaking wet.</p><h3>Step 3: Comb the Hair</h3><p>Use a comb to smooth out any tangles and make sure the hair is lying flat against the head. This will make it easier to cut evenly.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Hair</h3><p>Starting at the nape of the neck, use your scissors to trim the hair in small, even sections. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut straight across, using the comb as a guide to keep the hair in place.</p><h3>Step 5: Check Your Work</h3><p>Once you’ve finished cutting, check the back of your toddler’s head in a mirror to make sure the hair is even and tidy. Make any necessary adjustments using your scissors.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here’s a more detailed step-by-step guide to cutting the back of toddler boy hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose Your Style</h3><p>Before you start cutting, decide on the style you want for your toddler’s hair.
