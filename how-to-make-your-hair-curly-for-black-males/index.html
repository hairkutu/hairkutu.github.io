Start by washing and conditioning your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. Dry your hair with a towel, but don't rub it aggressively. Instead, gently squeeze out the excess water.</p><p>Next, apply a heat protectant spray to your hair to prevent damage from the curling iron. This is especially important for black males because our hair can be more prone to dryness and breakage.</p><h2 id="tools">Tools You'll Need</h2><p>To make your hair curly, you'll need a few tools:</p><ul><li>Curling iron</li><li>Wide-tooth comb</li><li>Hair clips</li><li>Hair gel or mousse (optional)</li></ul><h2 id="curling">Curling Your Hair</h2><p>Now that your hair is prepped and you have your tools, it's time to start curling. Here's how:</p><ol><li>Section your hair into small sections using hair clips.</li><li>Starting with the bottom section, take a small piece of hair and wrap it around the curling iron barrel, holding it for 5-10 seconds. Be careful not to burn yourself!</li><li>Release the hair from the curling iron and repeat until all sections are curled.</li><li>Once all sections are curled, use a wide-tooth comb to gently separate the curls.</li><li>If you want a more defined look, apply hair gel or mousse to your curls and scrunch them with your hands.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Curls</h2><p>Now that you have your curls, here are a few tips to keep them looking great:</p><ul><li>Sleep with a satin or silk pillowcase to prevent frizz.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair too often, as this can dry out your curls.</li><li>If you do wash your hair, use a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner to keep your curls hydrated.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about making your hair curly:</p><h3>Can I use a diffuser instead of a curling iron?</h3><p>Yes! A diffuser attachment on a blow dryer can be used to create curls as well.
