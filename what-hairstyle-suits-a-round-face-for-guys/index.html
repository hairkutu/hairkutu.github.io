Look no further! In this article, we will discuss the best hairstyles that suit a round face for guys. We will cover everything from how to choose the right hairstyle, step-by-step instructions on how to achieve the look, tips, FAQs, and hair care. Let's get started!</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to-choose">How to Choose the Right Hairstyle</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care for Your Hairstyle</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to-choose">How to Choose the Right Hairstyle</h2><p>When it comes to choosing the right hairstyle for a round face, there are a few things to keep in mind. The first is to avoid hairstyles that make your face look even rounder. This includes hairstyles that add volume to the sides of your head or styles with too much height on top. Instead, opt for a hairstyle that elongates your face and adds definition to your jawline. Here are a few hairstyles to consider:</p><h3>Crew Cut</h3><p>A crew cut is a classic hairstyle that suits almost any face shape. It's a low-maintenance style that's perfect for guys who don't want to spend too much time styling their hair. The crew cut is also a great option for guys with a round face as it adds definition to the jawline.</p><h3>Side Part</h3><p>The side part is a timeless hairstyle that's perfect for guys with a round face. The side part adds definition to the face by creating a diagonal line that elongates the face. To achieve this look, simply comb your hair to one side and use a bit of pomade to keep it in place.</p><h3>Undercut</h3><p>The undercut is a popular hairstyle that's been trending for a few years now. It's a versatile style that can be customized to suit any face shape. For guys with a round face, we recommend a disconnected undercut, which features a longer top and shorter sides. This style adds height to the top of the head, which elongates the face.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Instructions</h2><p>Now that you've chosen a hairstyle that suits your round face, it's time to learn how to achieve the look. Here are step-by-step instructions for each of the hairstyles we mentioned:</p><h3>Crew Cut</h3><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Use clippers to trim your hair to your desired length. We recommend a length of 1-2 inches.</li><li>Use scissors to trim any longer hairs on top of your head.</li><li>Use a comb to tidy up any uneven spots.</li><li>Apply a bit of pomade to your hair and use your fingers to style it into place.</li></ol><h3>Side Part</h3><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Use a comb to create a deep side part on one side of your head.</li><li>Apply a bit of pomade to your hair and use your fingers to style it into place.</li><li>Use a bit of hairspray to keep your hair in place.</li></ol><h3>Undercut</h3><ol><li>Start with clean, dry hair.</li><li>Use clippers to shave the sides of your head to your desired length.</li><li>Leave the top of your hair longer, around 3-4 inches.</li><li>Apply a bit of pomade to your hair and use your fingers to style it into place.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Maintaining Your Hairstyle</h2><p>Now that you've achieved the perfect hairstyle, it's important to maintain it. Here are a few tips to help you keep your hair looking great:</p><ul><li>Visit your barber every 4-6 weeks to keep your hair trimmed and looking neat.</li><li>Use a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li><li>Avoid using too much product, as this can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li><li>Invest in a good quality comb or brush to help you style your hair.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q: Can guys with a round face pull off a buzz cut?</h3><p>A: Yes, guys with a round face can pull off a buzz cut. However, we recommend leaving a bit of length on top to add definition to the face.</p><h3>Q: What should I do if I don't like my new hairstyle?</h3><p>A: If you don't like your new hairstyle, don't panic! Hair grows back. Speak to your barber and ask for their advice on how to modify the style to better suit your face shape.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Your Hairstyle</h2><p>Proper hair care is essential for maintaining a healthy head of hair. Here are a few tips to keep your hair looking great:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair every 2-3 days with a high-quality shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools, such as straighteners or curling irons, as these can damage your hair.</li><li>Avoid over-washing your hair, as this can strip it of its natural oils and cause it to become dry and brittle.</li><li>Invest in a good quality hairbrush or comb and use it to detangle your hair gently.</li></ul><p>Now that you know what hairstyle suits a round face for guys, it's time to head to the barber and try out a new look!
