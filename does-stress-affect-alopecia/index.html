When the body is under stress, it releases a hormone called cortisol. High levels of cortisol can cause inflammation and damage to hair follicles, which can lead to hair loss.</p><p>In addition, stress can also affect the immune system, making it more likely to attack hair follicles. This can lead to a condition called alopecia areata, which causes patchy hair loss on the scalp and other parts of the body.</p><h2 id="signs-of-stress-induced-alopecia">Signs of Stress-Induced Alopecia</h2><p>The signs of stress-induced alopecia vary depending on the type of alopecia. However, common symptoms include:</p><ul><li>Increased hair shedding</li><li>Thinning hair</li><li>Bald patches on the scalp or other parts of the body</li><li>Scalp inflammation or irritation</li></ul><p>If you are experiencing any of these symptoms, it is important to see a doctor or dermatologist.

Scarring alopecia is a type of alopecia that destroys hair follicles and replaces them with scar tissue.

Treatment options may include medications, such as corticosteroids, or hair restoration procedures, such as hair transplants.</p><h3>How long does it take for hair to grow back after stress-induced alopecia?</h3><p>The length of time it takes for hair to grow back after stress-induced alopecia depends on the severity of the condition.
