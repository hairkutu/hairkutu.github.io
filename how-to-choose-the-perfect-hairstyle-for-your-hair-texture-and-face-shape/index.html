Hair texture can be classified as fine, medium, or thick. Fine hair is delicate and often lacks volume, while thick hair is heavy and requires more styling time. Medium hair is somewhere in between.</p><p>Another factor to consider is whether your hair is straight, wavy, curly, or coily. Straight hair is naturally sleek and shiny, while wavy hair has a slight bend. Curly hair has defined curls, and coily hair has tight coils or kinks.</p><h2 id="face-shape">Understanding Face Shape</h2><p>Knowing your face shape is essential in choosing a hairstyle that flatters your features. There are six basic face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, diamond, and oblong. To determine your face shape, pull your hair back and look in the mirror. Use a measuring tape to measure your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline.</p><p>An oval face has balanced proportions, with a forehead that's slightly wider than the chin. A round face has soft curves and a rounded chin. A square face has a strong jawline and a forehead that's roughly the same width as the cheekbones. A heart-shaped face has a broad forehead and a pointed chin. A diamond-shaped face has high cheekbones and a narrow forehead and jawline. An oblong face is longer than it is wide, with a narrow chin and forehead.</p><h2 id="how-to-choose">How to Choose the Perfect Hairstyle</h2><p>Once you understand your hair texture and face shape, it's time to choose a hairstyle that suits you.

If you have thick hair, layers can help add dimension and movement.</li><li>Think about your lifestyle.
