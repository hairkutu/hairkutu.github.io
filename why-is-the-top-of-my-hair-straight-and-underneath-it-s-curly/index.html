This can be frustrating, especially if you want your curls to be uniform. In this article, we'll explore why this happens and what you can do to get more consistent curls.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The reason why the top of your hair is straight while the underneath is curly has to do with the way your hair grows. Hair growth patterns are different for everyone, and genetics play a big role in determining how your hair grows. Some people have hair that grows outwards, while others have hair that grows downwards. The direction of hair growth can also change throughout your life, so what worked for you in the past may not work for you now.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you're struggling with uneven curls, there are some things you can do to encourage more consistent growth patterns. Here are a few tips:</p><h3>1. Get regular trims</h3><p>Getting regular trims can help promote more consistent hair growth. When you trim your hair, you remove split ends and damaged hair, which can prevent healthy hair from growing. Trimming your hair every 6-8 weeks can help you maintain healthy hair and promote even growth patterns.</p><h3>2. Use a diffuser</h3><p>Using a diffuser can help you achieve more uniform curls. A diffuser is an attachment for your hair dryer that disperses air evenly over your curls, helping them to dry evenly. This can help prevent the top of your hair from being straight while the underneath is curly.</p><h3>3. Experiment with styling products</h3><p>Styling products can also help you achieve more consistent curls. Look for products that are designed for curly hair and experiment with different formulations to find what works best for you. Some products can help enhance your curls, while others can help smooth out any frizz.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Here are some steps you can take to promote more consistent hair growth:</p><h3>1.
