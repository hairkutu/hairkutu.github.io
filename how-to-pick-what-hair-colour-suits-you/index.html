With so many options available, it's important to consider your skin tone, eye colour, and personal style to find the perfect shade. In this article, we'll guide you through how to pick what hair colour suits you, step by step.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#step1">Step 1: Determine Your Skin Tone</a></li><li><a href="#step2">Step 2: Consider Your Eye Colour</a></li><li><a href="#step3">Step 3: Think About Your Personal Style</a></li><li><a href="#step4">Step 4: Determine the Undertones of Your Current Hair Colour</a></li><li><a href="#step5">Step 5: Consult with a Professional</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Choosing the Right Hair Colour</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#haircare">Hair Care Tips for Maintaining Your New Hair Colour</a></li></ul><h2 id="step1">Step 1: Determine Your Skin Tone</h2><p>The first step in choosing the right hair colour is to determine your skin tone. This will help you narrow down which shades will complement your complexion best. There are three main categories of skin tone: cool, warm, and neutral.</p><p>If you have cool undertones, you have pink, red, or bluish undertones in your skin. You'll look best in cool shades of hair colour, like ash blonde, platinum blonde, or cool brown. If you have warm undertones, you have yellow, peach, or golden undertones in your skin. You'll look best in warm shades of hair colour, like golden blonde, caramel, or auburn. If you have neutral undertones, you have a mix of both warm and cool undertones in your skin. You'll look great in a variety of shades, but try to avoid hair colours that are too warm or too cool.</p><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Consider Your Eye Colour</h2><p>After determining your skin tone, consider your eye colour. Certain shades of hair colour can bring out the colour of your eyes and make them pop. If you have blue or green eyes, try shades of blonde or light brown. If you have brown eyes, warm shades like caramel or auburn will look beautiful. If you have hazel eyes, choose shades that have both warm and cool tones.</p><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Think About Your Personal Style</h2><p>Your personal style is another important factor to consider when choosing a hair colour. If you prefer a natural look, choose a shade that's close to your natural hair colour. If you're more adventurous, try a bold shade like red or purple. If you're not sure what you want, bring in pictures of hair colours you like to show your stylist.</p><h2 id="step4">Step 4: Determine the Undertones of Your Current Hair Colour</h2><p>If you have existing hair colour, it's important to consider the undertones when choosing a new shade. If your current hair colour has warm undertones, choose a hair colour with warm undertones as well. If your current hair colour has cool undertones, choose a hair colour with cool undertones.</p><h2 id="step5">Step 5: Consult with a Professional</h2><p>Finally, it's always best to consult with a professional hairstylist before making a drastic change to your hair colour. They can help you choose a shade that will complement your skin tone, eye colour, and personal style. They can also recommend hair care products to maintain your new colour and keep your hair healthy.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Choosing the Right Hair Colour</h2><ul><li>Consider the maintenance required for the hair colour you choose. Some shades require more upkeep than others.</li><li>If you're not ready for a drastic change, try adding highlights or lowlights to your natural hair colour.</li><li>Bring in pictures of hair colours you like to show your stylist.</li><li>Remember that your hair colour can affect your makeup routine. Adjust your makeup accordingly after changing your hair colour.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>What if I have multiple colours in my hair?</h3><p>If you have multiple colours in your hair, try to choose a shade that complements all of the colours.

Just be sure to use hair care products that are formulated for curly hair to maintain your curls.</p><h3>What if I don't like my new hair colour?</h3><p>If you don't like your new hair colour, consult with your hairstylist to see if they can adjust it.
