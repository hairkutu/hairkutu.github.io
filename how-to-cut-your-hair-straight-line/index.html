Make sure it's free of tangles and knots.</p><h3>Step 2: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Use the comb to divide your hair into four sections: two at the front and two at the back. Secure each section with hair clips or ties.</p><h3>Step 3: Cut the Back Section</h3><p>Start with the back section. Release one section at a time and comb through it. Hold the hair between your fingers at the desired length and use the scissors to cut straight across. Repeat this step for each section.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the Front Section</h3><p>Once you're done with the back, move on to the front sections. Release one section at a time and comb through it. Bring the hair forward and hold it between your fingers at the desired length. Use the scissors to cut straight across.</p><h3>Step 5: Check for Evenness</h3><p>After you're done cutting, check your hair in the mirror to make sure it's even.
