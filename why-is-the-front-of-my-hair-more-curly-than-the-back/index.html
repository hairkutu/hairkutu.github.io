This can be frustrating, especially if you're trying to achieve a certain look or style. In this article, we'll explore why this happens and what you can do to prevent it from happening.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The front of your hair is more curly than the back because it's exposed to more heat and manipulation. When you style your hair, you're more likely to use heat tools like flat irons and curling irons on the front of your hair, which can cause damage and breakage.
