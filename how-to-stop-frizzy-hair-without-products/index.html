Here are some ways to tame frizz without using any products:</p><h3>1. Use a Microfiber Towel</h3><p>Traditional towels can be rough on hair and cause frizz. Instead, try using a microfiber towel or a t-shirt to gently blot your hair dry after washing. This will help reduce friction and prevent frizz.</p><h3>2. Don't Over-Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils and cause frizz. Try to wash your hair no more than two or three times a week, and use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo.</p><h3>3. Use a Wide-Tooth Comb</h3><p>Brushing your hair can cause breakage and frizz. Instead, try using a wide-tooth comb to gently detangle your hair. Start at the ends and work your way up to the roots.</p><h3>4. Sleep on a Silk Pillowcase</h3><p>Cotton pillowcases can absorb moisture from your hair and cause frizz. Silk pillowcases are gentler on hair and help prevent frizz while you sleep.</p><h3>5. Use Cold Water</h3><p>Hot water can strip your hair of its natural oils, causing frizz. Try rinsing your hair with cold water after shampooing and conditioning to help seal the cuticle and prevent frizz.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Follow these steps to manage frizzy hair without using any products:</p><h3>1.
