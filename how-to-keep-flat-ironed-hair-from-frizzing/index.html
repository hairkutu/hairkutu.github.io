Flat ironing your hair is a great way to achieve a sleek, straight look, but it can be frustrating when your hair starts to frizz up shortly after styling. In this blog post, we’ll share some tips and tricks for how to keep flat ironed hair from frizzing.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to">How to</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step by Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to">How to Keep Flat Ironed Hair from Frizzing</h2><p>There are a few things you can do before and after flat ironing your hair to help prevent frizz:</p><h3>1.

Look for a flat iron with ceramic plates, which will help distribute heat evenly and reduce frizz.</p><h3>5. Don’t touch your hair after styling</h3><p>Once you’ve finished flat ironing your hair, avoid touching it as much as possible.
