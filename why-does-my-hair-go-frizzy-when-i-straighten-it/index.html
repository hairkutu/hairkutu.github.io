However, you may have noticed that your hair can become frizzy after straightening it. This can be frustrating, especially if you have put in the effort to make your hair look sleek and smooth. In this article, we will explore the reasons why your hair goes frizzy when you straighten it and provide some tips on how to prevent it from happening.</p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#description">Description</a></li><li><a href="#how-to">How To</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step By Step</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQ</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care</a></li></ul><h2 id="description">Description</h2><p>Frizz is caused by the cuticle layer of your hair being raised, which allows moisture to enter and swell the hair shaft. When you straighten your hair, you are exposing it to heat, which can damage the cuticle layer and cause it to become raised. This allows moisture to enter the hair shaft, which can cause it to become frizzy.</p><h2 id="how-to">How To</h2><p>The best way to prevent frizz when straightening your hair is to use a heat protectant spray or serum. This will help to shield your hair from the heat and prevent damage to the cuticle layer. You should also make sure that your hair is completely dry before straightening it, as wet hair is more prone to damage and frizz.</p><h3>Step 1: Wash Your Hair</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo and conditioner. This will help to hydrate your hair and prevent it from becoming dry and brittle.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply a Heat Protectant</h3><p>Apply a heat protectant spray or serum to your hair before straightening it. This will help to shield your hair from the heat and prevent damage to the cuticle layer.</p><h3>Step 3: Use a Quality Straightener</h3><p>Invest in a high-quality straightener with ceramic plates. This will help to distribute the heat evenly and prevent hot spots, which can cause damage to your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Section Your Hair</h3><p>Section your hair and work on one section at a time. This will help to ensure that each section is straightened evenly and reduce the risk of damage.</p><h3>Step 5: Finish with a Serum</h3><p>Finish by applying a serum to your hair to add shine and prevent frizz. Make sure to use a serum that is lightweight and non-greasy, as heavy serums can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips</h2><ul><li>Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair before straightening it.
