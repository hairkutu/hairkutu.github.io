As a result, many mobile hairdressers are wondering what their options are for continuing to offer their services. In this article, we'll explore what mobile hairdressers in Tier 3 can do, as well as provide tips and advice for hair care during these challenging times.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Tier 3 areas are those with the highest level of COVID-19 restrictions. This means that certain businesses, including hair salons, may be forced to close or limit their services. Mobile hairdressers, who travel to clients' homes or workplaces, may also be affected by these restrictions.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>Mobile hairdressers in Tier 3 may be able to continue offering their services in some capacity. However, it is important to follow all government guidelines and safety protocols to protect both the hairdresser and the client. Here are some steps to take:</p><h3>Step 1: Check Local Guidelines</h3><p>Before offering your services as a mobile hairdresser in a Tier 3 area, it is important to check the local guidelines. Some areas may have stricter restrictions than others, and it is important to follow all guidelines to avoid any legal or health issues.</p><h3>Step 2: Consider Virtual Services</h3><p>If you cannot offer your services in person, consider offering virtual services. You can offer consultations, tutorials, and advice over video chat or phone. This is a great way to continue offering your services and generating income, while also keeping everyone safe.</p><h3>Step 3: Follow Safety Protocols</h3><p>If you are able to offer in-person services, it is important to follow all safety protocols. This includes wearing a mask, washing your hands regularly, and sanitizing all equipment and surfaces. You should also ensure that your clients are following safety protocols, such as wearing a mask and washing their hands before and after the appointment.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips for mobile hairdressers in Tier 3:</p><h3>Tip 1: Offer Flexible Services</h3><p>During these uncertain times, clients may have different needs and schedules. Consider offering flexible services, such as early morning or late evening appointments, to accommodate their needs.</p><h3>Tip 2: Communicate Clearly with Clients</h3><p>Make sure to communicate clearly with your clients about safety protocols and any changes to your services. This will help to build trust and ensure that everyone is on the same page.</p><h2>FAQ</h2><p>Here are some frequently asked questions about mobile hairdressers in Tier 3:</p><h3>Q: Can mobile hairdressers in Tier 3 still offer in-person services?</h3><p>A: It depends on the local guidelines. Some areas may allow in-person services with safety protocols in place, while others may not.</p><h3>Q: Can mobile hairdressers offer virtual services?</h3><p>A: Yes, mobile hairdressers can offer virtual services, such as consultations and tutorials, to clients.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>During these challenging times, it is important to take care of your hair. Here are some tips:</p><h3>Tip 1: Use Quality Hair Products</h3><p>Invest in quality hair products that nourish and protect your hair. Look for products that are free of harsh chemicals and sulfates, which can damage your hair.</p><h3>Tip 2: Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling can damage your hair, so try to avoid using heat tools as much as possible. If you must use them, use a heat protectant spray and keep the heat setting low.</p><h3>Tip 3: Get Regular Haircuts</h3><p>Regular haircuts can keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends. If you cannot see your mobile hairdresser in person, consider trimming your hair yourself or with the help of a family member.</p><p>In conclusion, mobile hairdressers in Tier 3 can still offer their services with the proper safety protocols in place. It is important to check local guidelines and communicate clearly with clients. By following these tips and taking care of your hair, you can look and feel your best during these challenging times.</p></article>
