Look no further, as we have compiled a list of stunning hairstyles that will make you look and feel amazing on the special day. From elegant updos to romantic curls, these hairstyles are perfect for any wedding guest with shoulder length hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Shoulder length hair is perfect for experimenting with different hairstyles, whether you prefer soft waves or a sleek updo. When it comes to weddings, you want a hairstyle that is elegant, sophisticated, and complements your outfit. The hairstyles we have chosen are easy to create, and they will ensure that you stand out as a stylish and chic wedding guest.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>To create these hairstyles, you will need a few essential hair tools, such as a curling iron, hairpins, a hairbrush, and hairspray. You can also add hair accessories to enhance your look, such as a headband, a flower clip, or a sparkly hairpin. Follow these steps to create these stunning hairstyles:</p><h3>1. Soft Waves</h3><p>Soft waves are perfect for a romantic and effortless look. Start by curling your hair with a curling iron, leaving the ends straight for a natural look. Brush through your curls with a hairbrush to create loose waves, then finish with hairspray to hold the style in place.</p><h3>2. Sleek Updo</h3><p>A sleek updo is perfect for a formal wedding. Start by brushing your hair back and gathering it into a low ponytail. Twist the ponytail into a bun and secure it with hairpins. Finish with hairspray to keep the style in place.</p><h3>3. Half-Up Half-Down</h3><p>A half-up half-down hairstyle is perfect for showing off your shoulder length hair while still keeping it out of your face. Start by curling your hair with a curling iron, then section off the top half of your hair and secure it with a hair tie. You can leave it straight or add some loose waves for a more romantic look.</p><h3>4. Braided Bun</h3><p>A braided bun is perfect for a boho-chic wedding. Start by braiding a small section of hair at the front of your head, then gather the rest of your hair into a low ponytail. Twist the ponytail into a bun and secure it with hairpins. Finish by wrapping the braided section around the bun and securing it with hairpins.</p><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>Follow these step-by-step instructions to create these stunning hairstyles:</p><h3>1.
