Then you should try out goddess braids! These beautiful braids are perfect for any occasion, whether you're going to a wedding or just running errands. But before you can start braiding, you need to know what kind of curly hair to use. In this article, we'll discuss the different types of curly hair for goddess braids and give you some tips for maintaining your braids once they're done.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Goddess braids are a type of African braiding style that involves creating large, intricate braids that are usually styled in an updo. These braids are perfect for anyone who wants a low-maintenance yet glamorous hairstyle. They can be done on any hair type, but they look particularly stunning on curly hair.</p><h2>How To</h2><p>If you want to try out goddess braids on your curly hair, here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>Choose your hair extensions. There are several types of hair extensions to choose from, including synthetic hair, human hair, and kanekalon hair. Synthetic hair is the most affordable option, but it doesn't last as long as human hair. Kanekalon hair is a synthetic hair that looks and feels like real hair. Human hair is the most natural-looking option, but it's also the most expensive.</li><li>Wash and condition your hair. It's important to start with clean, moisturized hair. Use a sulfate-free shampoo and a deep conditioner to keep your curls hydrated.</li><li>Cornrow your hair. Cornrowing your hair will create a base for your goddess braids. Make sure to cornrow your hair tightly so that the braids don't slip out.</li><li>Add the extensions. Take a strand of hair extensions and fold it in half. Place the folded end of the extension against your scalp and braid it into your cornrow. Braid the extension along with your natural hair until you reach the end.</li><li>Continue braiding. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have braided all of your hair.</li><li>Style your braids. Once you've finished braiding, you can style your braids in any way you like. You can wear them in an updo or let them hang loose.</li></ol><h2>Step by Step</h2><p>If you're still not sure how to do goddess braids on your curly hair, here's a step-by-step guide:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose your hair extensions</h3><p>Decide on the type of hair extensions you want to use.
