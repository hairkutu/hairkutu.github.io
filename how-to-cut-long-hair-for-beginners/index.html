Once you've decided on the length, it's time to get started!</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Start by washing and drying your hair. This will help you see the natural shape of your hair and make it easier to cut.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Section off your hair into manageable sections using hair clips. Start at the back of your head, and work your way forward.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Take a small section of hair from one of the sections you've clipped up. Comb it out, and hold it between your index and middle fingers. Use your other hand to hold the scissors, and cut the hair to your desired length.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Move onto the next section of hair, and repeat the process. Make sure to cut the hair in small sections to ensure an even cut.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you've cut all the sections, take a look in the mirror to check for any uneven spots. If you notice any areas that need fixing, snip them with your scissors.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Cutting Long Hair</h2><p><strong>Tip 1:</strong> Always cut your hair when it's dry.

You can always cut more, but you can't put hair back on!</p><p><strong>Tip 3:</strong> Use your fingers to measure the length of your hair.
