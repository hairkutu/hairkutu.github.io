This style features a short or shaved fade on the sides and back, with longer hair on top. It’s a popular hairstyle that has been around for a while and continues to be a favorite among men of all ages. In this guide, we’ll show you everything you need to know about this style, from how to get it to how to maintain it.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The men’s haircut fade sides long top is a modern hairstyle that combines short sides and a longer top. The hair on the sides and back is cut short, usually with a clipper, and gradually fades into longer hair on top. The top can be styled in a variety of ways, such as slicked-back, messy, or textured. This hairstyle is versatile and can be tailored to suit different face shapes and hair types.</p><h2>How to Get the Men’s Haircut Fade Sides Long Top</h2><p>If you want to get the men’s haircut fade sides long top, the first step is to find a good barber or hairstylist who is experienced in this style. Once you’ve found someone you trust, here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Choose the Right Length</h3><p>The first step is to decide how short you want the sides and back to be. The fade can be high, medium, or low, depending on your preference. The top can be left long, or you can ask your barber to trim it to a specific length.</p><h3>Step 2: Consult with Your Barber</h3><p>Before your barber starts cutting your hair, make sure to consult with them about the style you want. Show them pictures of the men’s haircut fade sides long top that you like and ask for their opinion on what would work best for your face shape and hair type.</p><h3>Step 3: Get the Cut</h3><p>Once you’ve agreed on the style, your barber will start cutting your hair. They will use clippers to create the fade on the sides and back, gradually blending the shorter hair into the longer hair on top. They may also use scissors to trim the top to your desired length and style.</p><h3>Step 4: Style Your Hair</h3><p>After the cut, your barber will style your hair using products such as pomade, wax, or gel. They may also blow-dry your hair to create volume or texture.
