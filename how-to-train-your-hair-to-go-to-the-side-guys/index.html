It won't happen overnight, but with time and effort, you can achieve the look you want. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Make sure your hair is clean and completely dry before you start training it to go to the side.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product such as a pomade, wax or gel to your hair. Use a small amount and work it through your hair evenly. This will help to hold your hair in place and make it easier to style.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a hairdryer, blow dry your hair in the direction you want it to go. Use a round brush to create volume and shape. Make sure your hair is completely dry before moving on to the next step.</p><h3>Step 4: Train Your Hair</h3><p>Now it's time to train your hair to go to the side. Use a comb or your fingers to push your hair in the direction you want it to go. Hold it in place for a few seconds, then release. Do this several times until your hair starts to hold its shape.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintain Your Style</h3><p>Once you have trained your hair to go to the side, it's important to maintain the style. Use a small amount of styling product to touch up any areas that need it throughout the day. You can also use a hairspray to hold your hair in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Training Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you train your hair to go to the side:</p><ul><li>Start with a shorter hairstyle â it's easier to train shorter hair than longer hair.</li><li>Use a comb or brush to help train your hair in the right direction.</li><li>Be patient â it takes time for your hair to get used to the new style.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the one that works best for you.</li><li>Visit a barber or hair stylist for regular trims to keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to train your hair to go to the side?</h3><p>It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to train your hair to go to the side.

After that, you can train it less frequently, but it's still important to maintain the style with a bit of styling product.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips</h2><p>It's important to take good care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons too often â they can damage your hair.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner or hair mask once a week to keep your hair moisturized.</li></ul><p>That's it for our guide on how to train your hair to go to the side guys.
