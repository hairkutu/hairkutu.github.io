This hairstyle is versatile and can work for both casual and formal occasions. In this article, we will be sharing some tips on how to train your hair to go to the side guys, along with some frequently asked questions and hair care tips. </p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><ol><li><a href="#how-to">How to Train Your Hair to Go to the Side Guys</a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</a></li><li><a href="#tips">Tips for Training Your Hair</a></li><li><a href="#faq">FAQs</a></li><li><a href="#hair-care">Hair Care Tips</a></li></ol><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Before we get started, it's important to note that training your hair to go to the side requires patience and consistency. It won't happen overnight, but with time and effort, you can achieve the look you want. Here are the steps to follow:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with Clean Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Make sure your hair is clean and completely dry before you start training it to go to the side.</p><h3>Step 2: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a styling product such as a pomade, wax or gel to your hair. Use a small amount and work it through your hair evenly. This will help to hold your hair in place and make it easier to style.</p><h3>Step 3: Blow Dry Your Hair</h3><p>Using a hairdryer, blow dry your hair in the direction you want it to go. Use a round brush to create volume and shape. Make sure your hair is completely dry before moving on to the next step.</p><h3>Step 4: Train Your Hair</h3><p>Now it's time to train your hair to go to the side. Use a comb or your fingers to push your hair in the direction you want it to go. Hold it in place for a few seconds, then release. Do this several times until your hair starts to hold its shape.</p><h3>Step 5: Maintain Your Style</h3><p>Once you have trained your hair to go to the side, it's important to maintain the style. Use a small amount of styling product to touch up any areas that need it throughout the day. You can also use a hairspray to hold your hair in place.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Training Your Hair</h2><p>Here are some additional tips to help you train your hair to go to the side:</p><ul><li>Start with a shorter hairstyle – it's easier to train shorter hair than longer hair.</li><li>Use a comb or brush to help train your hair in the right direction.</li><li>Be patient – it takes time for your hair to get used to the new style.</li><li>Experiment with different styling products to find the one that works best for you.</li><li>Visit a barber or hair stylist for regular trims to keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>How long does it take to train your hair to go to the side?</h3><p>It can take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks to train your hair to go to the side.

It may take a bit more effort, but it's definitely doable. Use a strong styling product and a comb to help keep your curls in place.</p><h3>How often do I need to train my hair?</h3><p>You should train your hair every day until it starts to hold its shape. After that, you can train it less frequently, but it's still important to maintain the style with a bit of styling product.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care Tips</h2><p>It's important to take good care of your hair to keep it healthy and looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Wash your hair regularly with a shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type.</li><li>Avoid using hot tools such as straighteners and curling irons too often – they can damage your hair.</li><li>Eat a healthy diet rich in vitamins and minerals to promote healthy hair growth.</li><li>Get regular haircuts to keep your hair looking neat and tidy.</li><li>Use a leave-in conditioner or hair mask once a week to keep your hair moisturized.</li></ul><p>That's it for our guide on how to train your hair to go to the side guys.
