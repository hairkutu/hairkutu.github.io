Curly hair, on the other hand, is characterized by tighter, more defined curls that form in a spiral or ringlet pattern.</p><p>While some people may have hair that falls somewhere in between wavy and curly, most people can easily distinguish between the two. If you're still not sure whether your hair is wavy or curly, keep reading.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Determine if Your Hair is Wavy or Curly</h2><p>The easiest way to determine your hair type is to examine your hair's curl pattern. To do this, follow these steps:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition Your Hair</h3><p>Start with clean, wet hair. Use a gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and a moisturizing conditioner to help define your hair's natural curl pattern.</p><h3>Step 2: Don't Brush or Comb Your Hair</h3><p>Once you've washed and conditioned your hair, don't brush or comb it. Doing so can disrupt your hair's natural curl pattern and make it harder to determine your hair type.</p><h3>Step 3: Let Your Hair Air Dry</h3><p>Allow your hair to air dry naturally without using a blow dryer. This will help you see your hair's natural curl pattern without any interference from heat styling tools.</p><h3>Step 4: Observe Your Hair's Curl Pattern</h3><p>Once your hair is dry, observe its curl pattern. If your hair has loose, gentle waves that flow in an S-shape pattern, it's likely wavy. If your hair has tighter, more defined curls that form in a spiral or ringlet pattern, it's likely curly.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Caring for Wavy and Curly Hair</h2><p>Whether your hair is wavy or curly, it's important to care for it properly to keep it healthy and looking its best.

If you must use them, use a heat protectant spray to minimize damage to your hair.</li><li>Consider using a leave-in conditioner or curl-defining cream to help enhance your hair's natural curl pattern.</li><li>Avoid touching your hair too much. The natural oils from your scalp can help keep your hair healthy and shiny.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Q. Can wavy hair turn curly?</h3><p>A.
