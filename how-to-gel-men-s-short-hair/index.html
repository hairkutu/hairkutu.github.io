Here are the steps to follow when gelling men's short hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>Before applying gel, make sure your hair is clean and dry. Shampoo and condition your hair, then towel-dry it to remove any excess moisture. Avoid using a hairdryer, as it can damage your hair and make it harder to style.</p><h3>Step 2: Choose the right type of gel</h3><p>Not all gels are created equal, and some are better suited for short hair than others. Look for a gel that is lightweight and has a strong hold. Avoid gels that are too thick or heavy, as they can weigh your hair down and make it look greasy.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply the gel</h3><p>Start by taking a small amount of gel and rubbing it between your palms to warm it up. Then, apply the gel evenly to your hair, starting from the roots and working your way to the tips. Use your fingers to style your hair as desired.</p><h3>Step 4: Finish with hairspray</h3><p>To help your hairstyle stay in place, finish with a light mist of hairspray. This will also help to add shine and control any flyaway hairs.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed, step-by-step guide on how to gel men's short hair:</p><ol><li>Wash and condition your hair using a gentle shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Towel-dry your hair to remove any excess moisture.
