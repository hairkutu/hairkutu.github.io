Almost everyone is experiencing hair fall, especially when taking a shower. But why is so much hair falling out in the shower? This article will answer your question and provide you with some tips on how to reduce hair loss.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Hair loss is a natural phenomenon. On average, a person loses 50-100 hairs per day. However, if you notice excessive hair fall in the shower, it might be a cause for concern. The main reason for hair fall in the shower is due to the wet hair, which is more prone to breakage. When you apply shampoo and conditioner, it weakens the hair follicles, making them more prone to fall out. The warm water also opens up the pores and makes it easier for the hair to fall out. </p><h2>How to Reduce Hair Fall in the Shower?</h2><h3>Step by Step</h3><p>Here are some simple steps that you can follow to reduce hair fall in the shower:</p><ol><li>Don't wash your hair every day. Washing hair frequently can weaken hair follicles, leading to hair fall. </li><li>Use a mild shampoo and conditioner that suits your hair type. Avoid using harsh chemicals that can damage your hair.</li><li>Don't use hot water to wash your hair. Warm water is enough to clean your scalp and hair. </li><li>Massage your scalp gently while shampooing. This will improve blood circulation and promote hair growth. </li><li>After washing your hair, use a soft towel to dry it. Don't rub your hair vigorously as it can cause hair breakage. </li><li>Use a wide-tooth comb to detangle your hair. Don't use a brush as it can pull out hair strands. </li><li>Avoid using hair dryers, straighteners, and curling irons as they can damage your hair.</li></ol><h3>Tips</h3><p>Here are some additional tips that can help you reduce hair fall:</p><ul><li>Eat a healthy diet that includes proteins, vitamins, and minerals. </li><li>Drink plenty of water to keep your hair hydrated. </li><li>Get enough sleep as it promotes hair growth. </li><li>Avoid stress as it can lead to hair loss. </li><li>Be gentle with your hair. Don't tie it too tightly or use hairbands that can pull out hair. </li></ul><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q. Why is so much hair falling out in the shower?</h3><p>A.
