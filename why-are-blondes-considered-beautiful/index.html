In ancient Greece, blonde hair was seen as a sign of youth and fertility. In the Renaissance era, blonde hair was considered the epitome of beauty, and women would often dye their hair blonde using natural ingredients such as saffron and chamomile.

It's important to follow the instructions carefully and to use a deep conditioning treatment afterwards to prevent damage.</p><h4>Can anyone go blonde?</h4><p>In theory, anyone can go blonde. However, if you have naturally dark hair, it may be more difficult and time-consuming to achieve the desired shade of blonde. It's also important to consider your skin tone when choosing a shade of blonde that will complement your complexion.</p><h4>What's the difference between highlights and balayage?</h4><p>Highlights and balayage are both hair coloring techniques used to create dimension and depth in the hair. The main difference is in the application method. Highlights involve using foils to isolate sections of hair and lighten them, while balayage involves painting the color onto the hair freehand for a more natural, sun-kissed look.</p><p>So, there you have it - a comprehensive guide to why blondes are considered beautiful.
