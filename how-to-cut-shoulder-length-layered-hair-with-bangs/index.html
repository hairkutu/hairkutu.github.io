However, going to a salon can be expensive, so why not try cutting it yourself? With the right tools and techniques, you can achieve a great look from the comfort of your own home. In this article, we'll show you how to cut your shoulder length layered hair with bangs in a relaxed, easy-to-understand way. </p><h2>Description</h2><p>Shoulder length hair with layers and bangs is a popular hairstyle that can work for any hair type. It's versatile and can be styled in many ways. However, regular visits to the salon can be costly. Cutting your own hair can save you money and give you the freedom to experiment with your look.</p><h2>How To Cut Shoulder Length Layered Hair with Bangs</h2><h3>Step 1: Gather your tools</h3><p>Before you start cutting your hair, make sure you have the right tools. You'll need a pair of sharp hair cutting scissors, a comb, and hair clips to section off your hair. You may also want to have a mirror, a spray bottle with water, and a towel handy.</p><h3>Step 2: Wet your hair</h3><p>Wet your hair with a spray bottle or by washing it. Wet hair is easier to cut and allows you to see the length better. Use a towel to dry off any excess water.</p><h3>Step 3: Section your hair</h3><p>Use your comb to separate your hair into three sections: the top, the sides, and the back. Clip the top section of your hair away from the rest of your hair.</p><h3>Step 4: Cut the bangs</h3><p>Start by cutting the bangs. Take a small section of hair from the front of your head, and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it straight across. Make sure to cut it a little longer than you want it to be, as hair tends to shrink when it dries. </p><h3>Step 5: Cut the sides</h3><p>Unclip the side sections of your hair. Starting at the front, take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at an angle, following the length of your hair. Repeat this process for each section until you reach the back of your head. </p><h3>Step 6: Cut the back</h3><p>Unclip the back section of your hair. Starting at the bottom, take a small section of hair and comb it straight down. Hold the hair between your fingers and cut it at an angle, following the length of your hair. Repeat this process for each section until you reach the top of your head. </p><h3>Step 7: Blend the layers</h3><p>After you've cut all your hair, it's time to blend the layers. Take the top section of your hair and comb it straight up. Use your scissors to cut the ends of your hair at an angle, following the length of your hair. This will blend the layers and create a more natural look. </p><h3>Step 8: Check your work</h3><p>Use a mirror to check the back of your head and make sure everything is even. If you notice any uneven spots, trim them with your scissors.</p><h3>Step 9: Style your hair</h3><p>Once you're happy with your haircut, style your hair as desired. You can blow dry it straight, curl it, or leave it natural. </p><h2>Tips</h2><p>- Start by cutting a little bit of hair at a time, you can always cut more if needed. </p><p>- Use sharp scissors to avoid split ends. </p><p>- If you're not confident with cutting your own hair, practice on a mannequin head first. </p><h2>FAQ</h2><h3>Q: How often should I cut my hair?</h3><p>A: It depends on your hair type and how quickly it grows. On average, it's recommended to cut your hair every 6-8 weeks to maintain healthy hair.</p><h3>Q: Can I cut my own hair if I have curly hair?</h3><p>A: Yes, you can cut your own hair if you have curly hair. However, it's important to cut it when it's dry and to avoid cutting too much at once.</p><h2>Hair Care</h2><p>After cutting your hair, it's important to take care of it. Use a shampoo and conditioner that's appropriate for your hair type, and avoid using too much heat when styling your hair. Regular trims will also help keep your hair healthy and prevent split ends.</p><p>Now that you know how to cut your shoulder length layered hair with bangs, you can experiment with different styles and save money on salon visits. Remember to take it slow, cut a little bit at a time, and have fun with it!</p></article>
