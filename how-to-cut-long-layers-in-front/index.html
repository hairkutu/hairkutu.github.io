Here are the basic steps:</p><h3>1. Start with clean, dry hair</h3><p>It's important to start with clean, dry hair so you can accurately see the length and texture of your hair. Make sure your hair is completely dry before you start cutting.</p><h3>2. Determine the length of the layers</h3><p>Decide how long you want your layers to be. If you're not sure, start with a longer length and gradually cut more if needed. Remember, you can always cut more, but you can't add hair back once it's cut.</p><h3>3. Section off the hair you want to cut</h3><p>Using a comb, section off the hair you want to cut into a triangular shape. The point of the triangle should be at the center of your forehead, and the base should be at the sides of your head.</p><h3>4. Cut the hair at a slight angle</h3><p>Hold the hair between your fingers and cut at a slight angle, starting from the shortest point at the center of your forehead and gradually getting longer towards the sides of your head. This will create a soft, blended look.</p><h3>5. Check for balance</h3><p>Once you've finished one side, check for balance by comparing it to the other side. Make any necessary adjustments to ensure both sides are even.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a more detailed guide to cutting long layers in front:</p><h3>Step 1: Gather your tools</h3><p>You'll need a pair of sharp hair cutting scissors, a comb, and hair clips to keep your hair in place.</p><h3>Step 2: Wash and dry your hair</h3><p>Start with clean, dry hair so you can accurately see the length and texture of your hair.</p><h3>Step 3: Section off the hair</h3><p>Using a comb, section off the hair you want to cut into a triangular shape.
