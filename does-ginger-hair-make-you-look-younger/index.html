It is caused by a genetic variation in the MC1R gene that affects the production of pigment in hair follicles. People with ginger hair often have fair skin and freckles, which are also associated with youthfulness.</p><p>There is no scientific evidence to suggest that having ginger hair makes you look younger.

First, it is important to choose a shade that complements your skin tone. If you have fair skin, a lighter shade of ginger may be more flattering. If you have darker skin, a darker shade of ginger may be more suitable.</p><p>You should also consider the maintenance required for ginger hair.

Some people may need touch-ups every 4-6 weeks, while others may be able to go longer between appointments.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care</h2><p>Caring for ginger hair is similar to caring for any other hair color.
