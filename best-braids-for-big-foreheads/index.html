However, not all braids work well for those with big foreheads. Here are some of the best braids for big foreheads:</p><h3>Dutch Braids</h3><p>Dutch braids are a great option for those with big foreheads. These braids start at the top of the head and are braided in a way that creates a raised, three-dimensional effect. This style draws attention away from the forehead and towards the braids themselves.</p><h3>Fishtail Braids</h3><p>Fishtail braids are another great option for those with big foreheads. These braids start at the nape of the neck and are braided in a way that creates a slimming effect. This style draws attention away from the forehead and towards the slim, elegant braid.</p><h3>Crown Braids</h3><p>Crown braids are a classic style that works well for those with big foreheads. These braids start at the front of the head and are braided in a circular pattern, creating a crown-like effect. This style draws attention away from the forehead and towards the beautiful braid.</p><h2 id="howto">How to Style Braids for Big Foreheads</h2><p>Now that you know which braids work best for big foreheads, it’s time to learn how to style them.

Make sure to braid tightly and evenly, and use a comb or your fingers to smooth out any bumps or flyaways.</p><h3>Step 5: Secure Your Braid</h3><p>Secure the end of your braid with a hair tie or bobby pins.
