Here's how to do it:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair and let it air dry until it's about 80% dry.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections, depending on how many buns you want.</li><li>Twist each section of hair tightly and wrap it around itself to create a bun.</li><li>Secure the bun with a hair tie or bobby pins.</li><li>Sleep with your buns in overnight.</li><li>Take out the buns in the morning and finger-comb your hair to separate the curls.</li></ol><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make your hair curly overnight using braids:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Towel dry your hair until it's no longer dripping wet.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections, depending on how many braids you want.</li><li>Braid each section of hair tightly and secure the ends with a hair tie.</li><li>Sleep with your braids in overnight.</li><li>Take out the braids in the morning and finger-comb your hair to separate the curls.</li><li>Apply a curl-defining cream or gel to your curls to hold their shape.</li></ol><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to make your hair curly overnight using buns:</p><ol><li>Wash your hair with a curl-enhancing shampoo and conditioner.</li><li>Towel dry your hair until it's no longer dripping wet.</li><li>Divide your hair into sections, depending on how many buns you want.</li><li>Twist each section of hair tightly and wrap it around itself to create a bun.</li><li>Secure the bun with a hair tie or bobby pins.</li><li>Sleep with your buns in overnight.</li><li>Take out the buns in the morning and finger-comb your hair to separate the curls.</li><li>Apply a curl-defining cream or gel to your curls to hold their shape.</li></ol><h2 id="tips">Tips for Making Your Hair Curly Overnight</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you make your hair curly overnight:</p><ul><li>Start with clean, damp hair.

Letting your hair dry naturally overnight is the safest and healthiest option.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Curly Hair</h2><p>Curly hair requires special care to keep it healthy and defined.
