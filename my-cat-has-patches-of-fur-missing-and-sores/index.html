This could be caused by various factors such as allergies, parasites, infections, and more. It is important to identify the root cause of the problem and address it immediately to prevent it from worsening. In this article, we will discuss the possible causes, how to treat them, and tips on how to take care of your cat's fur.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Fur loss and sores on cats can take on different forms, depending on the cause. Some cats may have bald patches on their skin, and the affected area could be red or inflamed. The sores may also be crusty or scabbed, and your cat may scratch or lick the area excessively. It is important to observe your cat's behavior and monitor any changes in their skin condition.</p><h2>How to Identify the Cause</h2><p>There are various reasons why your cat may have patches of fur missing and sores. Here are some of the most common causes:</p><h3>Allergies</h3><p>Cats can be allergic to a variety of things such as food, fleas, and pollen. Allergic reactions can cause inflammation, itching, and hair loss. If your cat is allergic to something, you may notice other symptoms such as sneezing, coughing, and watery eyes.</p><h3>Parasites</h3><p>Fleas, mites, and ticks can cause skin irritation and hair loss. These parasites feed on your cat's blood and can cause an allergic reaction. You may notice tiny red bumps on your cat's skin, and they may scratch or bite the area excessively.</p><h3>Infections</h3><p>Bacterial or fungal infections can cause hair loss and sores on your cat's skin. These infections can be caused by a weakened immune system, poor hygiene, or other underlying conditions. The affected area may be red, inflamed, and have a foul odor.</p><h2>How to Treat Patches of Fur Missing and Sores</h2><p>The treatment for your cat's condition depends on the cause.
