Your big nose is a part of who you are, and you should be proud of it. However, if you still want to enhance your features, here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Wear the right makeup</h3><p>Makeup can work wonders in enhancing your features. Focus on your eyes and lips to draw attention away from your nose.
