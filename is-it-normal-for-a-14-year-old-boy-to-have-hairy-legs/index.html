The answer is yes, it is completely normal for a 14-year-old boy to have hairy legs. In fact, it is common for boys to start developing body hair around this age. However, if you have any concerns about your body hair, it is always a good idea to talk to your doctor.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Body hair is a natural part of puberty and is influenced by hormones in the body. During puberty, the body starts to produce more androgens, which are male hormones that stimulate hair growth. This can cause hair to grow on the legs, arms, chest, back, and other parts of the body. Boys typically start to develop body hair around the age of 12 or 13, and it continues to grow and thicken throughout puberty.</p><h2>How to</h2><p>If you’re a 14-year-old boy who is starting to develop body hair, there are some things you can do to manage it:</p><h3>1. Shave</h3><p>If you don’t like the look of your body hair, you can shave it off. This is a temporary solution, but it can help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.

Be Gentle</h3><p>When shaving or waxing, be gentle to avoid cuts or irritation. Use a sharp razor, and avoid using too much pressure.</p><h3>2.
