This will help balance out your features and create a more proportional look. Some great short hairstyles for this face shape include:</p><ul><li>Pixie cut</li><li>Bob</li><li>Layered haircut</li><li>Short shag</li></ul><p>When choosing a style, consider your hair texture and lifestyle. If you have fine hair, a layered haircut can add volume and movement. If you're always on the go, a low-maintenance bob may be the perfect fit.</p><h3>Pixie Cut</h3><p>The pixie cut is a short, cropped style that can be customized to suit your face shape and hair texture. To add volume and width to a long face, consider a pixie cut with side-swept bangs or choppy layers. This will help create the illusion of a wider face and balance out your features.</p><h3>Bob</h3><p>The bob is a classic short hairstyle that can be customized in a variety of ways. For a long face, consider a chin-length bob with layers that add volume to the sides of your face. This will help create the illusion of a wider face and balance out your features.</p><h3>Layered Haircut</h3><p>A layered haircut can add volume and movement to fine hair, while also creating the illusion of a wider face. For a long face, consider a layered cut with long, face-framing layers that add width to the sides of your face.</p><h3>Short Shag</h3><p>The short shag is a textured, layered haircut that can add volume and movement to any hair type. For a long face, consider a shag with choppy layers and side-swept bangs.
