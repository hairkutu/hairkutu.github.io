Avoid leaving the bleach on your hair for too long, as this can cause severe hair damage.</p><h3>Protect Your Scalp</h3><p>Apply a protective cream or oil on your scalp before applying the bleach to prevent scalp irritation and hair loss.</p><h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide on Bleaching Hair</h2><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to bleach hair:</p><h3>Step 1: Prepare Your Hair</h3><p>Wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo to remove any dirt and buildup.
