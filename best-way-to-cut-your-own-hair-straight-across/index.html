Follow these steps to cut your hair straight across:</p><ol><li>Wash and dry your hair. It's important to start with clean, dry hair so you can see exactly how it will look when it's cut.</li><li>Comb your hair straight down. Make sure your hair is completely detangled and combed straight down from your crown to the nape of your neck.</li><li>Divide your hair.

Clip the top sections of your hair up and out of the way so you can focus on cutting the bottom sections first.</li><li>Cut the bottom sections. Using your comb as a guide, cut the bottom sections of your hair straight across. Be sure to cut small sections at a time to ensure an even cut.</li><li>Unclip the top sections. Once you're happy with the bottom sections, unclip the top sections and repeat the process of cutting small sections straight across.</li><li>Check for evenness.
