If the lighting is too bright, it can wash out your hair and make it appear thinner. If the lighting is too dark, it can make your hair look flat and lifeless.</li><li>The angle: The angle of the camera can also affect how your hair looks. If the camera is pointed down at your head, it can make your hair look flatter and thinner than it actually is.</li><li>The length: If your hair is longer, it can appear thinner on camera because the weight of the hair pulls it down and makes it look less voluminous.</li><li>The camera quality: Depending on the quality of the camera, it might not be able to capture all the details and textures of your hair.

Consider styles like loose waves or a messy bun to add texture and volume to your locks.</li><li>Use volumizing products: Products like mousse and volumizing spray can help add volume and fullness to your hair.
