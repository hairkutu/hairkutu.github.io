Also, make sure your nails are clean and free from any nail polish or dirt. You can do this technique for 5-10 minutes every day or as often as you'd like.</p><h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to rub your nails to prevent hair fall:</p><ol><li>Find a quiet and comfortable place where you can sit down and relax.</li><li>Sit with your back straight and your shoulders relaxed.</li><li>Place your hands on your lap with your palms facing up.</li><li>Touch the fingernails of both hands together.</li><li>Start rubbing your nails back and forth as fast as you can.</li><li>Continue rubbing for 5-10 minutes or longer if you'd like.</li><li>Take deep breaths while doing the technique to help you relax.</li><li>Repeat this practice every day or as often as you'd like.</li></ol><p>It's important to note that while this technique is safe for everyone, it may not work for everyone.
