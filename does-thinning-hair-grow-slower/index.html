If you are experiencing sudden or severe hair loss, it is important to consult with a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying medical conditions.</p><h2 id="section2">Does Thinning Hair Grow Slower?</h2><p>Contrary to popular belief, thinning hair does not necessarily grow slower than thicker hair. However, it may appear to grow slower because the hair shaft is thinner and more fragile. This can lead to breakage and split ends, which can make the hair appear shorter and thinner than it actually is.</p><p>In some cases, thinning hair may actually grow faster than thicker hair.

Can stress cause hair loss?</h3><p>A. Yes, stress can cause hair loss. When you are under stress, your body releases hormones that can disrupt the hair growth cycle.</p><h3>Q.

If you are experiencing hair loss after starting a new medication, talk to your healthcare provider.</p><h3>Q. Does hair grow faster in the summer?</h3><p>A. Hair growth is not affected by the season.
