It's a versatile style that can be worn in a variety of ways, from messy and tousled to slick and polished. Whether you're looking for a fresh new look or just want to switch things up a bit, a long hair on top haircut might be just what you need. In this guide, we'll cover everything you need to know about mens haircuts with long hair on top, including how to get the look, styling tips, and hair care advice.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Men's haircuts with long hair on top are characterized by having longer hair on the crown of the head, while the sides and back are shorter. The length on top can range from a few inches to shoulder-length or longer, depending on the desired look. This style can be achieved with a variety of hair textures, from straight to curly, and can be tailored to suit any face shape or personal style.</p><h2>How to Get the Look</h2><p>If you're interested in getting a mens haircut with long hair on top, the first step is to find a skilled hairstylist who can help you achieve the look you want. Start by researching different styles and finding inspiration photos to bring to your appointment. Once you've found a stylist you trust, communicate your preferences clearly and ask for their advice on what will work best for your hair type and face shape.</p><p>The actual cutting process will depend on the style you choose, but generally, the stylist will start by cutting the sides and back of your hair short, while leaving the hair on top longer. They may use scissors or clippers to achieve the desired length and texture. The length and shape of the top section can be customized to suit your preferences, whether you want a messy, tousled look or a sleek and polished finish.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide</h2><p>If you're looking to style your long hair on top at home, here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:</p><h3>Step 1: Wash and Condition</h3><p>Start by washing your hair with a high-quality shampoo and conditioner to remove any buildup or oil. This will help your hair look and feel clean and healthy.</p><h3>Step 2: Towel Dry</h3><p>Use a clean towel to gently pat your hair dry, leaving it slightly damp. Avoid rubbing your hair vigorously, as this can cause damage and frizz.</p><h3>Step 3: Apply Styling Product</h3><p>Apply a small amount of styling product, such as pomade or wax, to your fingertips and work it through your hair. Start at the roots and work your way up to the tips, focusing on the longer hair on top.</p><h3>Step 4: Style as Desired</h3><p>Use your fingers or a comb to style your hair as desired. For a messy, textured look, use your fingers to tousle your hair and create volume. For a sleeker look, use a comb to smooth down the hair on top and create a polished finish.</p><h2>Tips</h2><p>Here are some tips to help you get the most out of your mens haircut with long hair on top:</p><ul><li>Invest in high-quality styling products to help you achieve the look you want.</li><li>Don't be afraid to experiment with different styles and textures to find what works best for you.</li><li>Maintain regular haircuts to keep your hair looking healthy and prevent split ends.</li><li>Protect your hair from heat damage by using a heat protectant spray before styling with hot tools.</li><li>Consider using a leave-in conditioner or hair oil to keep your hair moisturized and shiny.</li></ul><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>1.
