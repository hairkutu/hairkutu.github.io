Hair curls when the hydrogen bonds in the hair strands are broken by heat or moisture. Once the bonds are broken, the hair can be molded into a new shape and then set in place. The new shape is held until the hydrogen bonds reform, which is why hair can hold a curl for several hours or even days.</p><p>Now, when it comes to hair length, it's important to note that the length of your hair doesn't affect the formation of hydrogen bonds. In other words, whether your hair is short or long, the hydrogen bonds will break and reform in the same way. So, the length of your hair doesn't determine whether your hair curls more or less.</p><h3 id="how-to">How to Curl Short Hair</h3><p>Now that we know that hair length doesn't affect curling, let's talk about how to curl short hair.
