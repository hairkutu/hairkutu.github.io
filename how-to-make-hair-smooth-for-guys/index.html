Use a heat protectant spray before blow-drying and use a round brush to help smooth your hair cuticles. </p><h3> Step 4: Use a Hair Serum </h3><p> A hair serum can help add shine and smoothness to your hair. Use a small amount of serum on your hair after blow-drying to help keep your hair smooth and frizz-free. </p><h2 id="tips"> Tips for Smooth Hair </h2><p> In addition to the steps above, here are some additional tips for smooth hair:</p><ul><li>Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent hair breakage and frizz.</li><li>Avoid using hair products that contain alcohol, as they can dry out your hair.</li><li>Don't rub your hair with a towel after washing it.
