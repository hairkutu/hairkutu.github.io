There are five main face shapes: oval, round, square, heart, and long. Here's how to determine which one you have:</p><ul><li><strong>Oval:</strong> Your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead is slightly wider than your chin.</li><li><strong>Round:</strong> Your face is nearly as wide as it is long, and your cheeks are the widest part of your face.</li><li><strong>Square:</strong> Your face is nearly as wide as it is long, and your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width.</li><li><strong>Heart:</strong> Your forehead is wider than your cheeks and narrows down to a pointed chin.</li><li><strong>Long:</strong> Your face is longer than it is wide, and your forehead, cheekbones, and jawline are all about the same width.</li></ul><p>Now that you know your face shape, let's talk about which lob will suit you best.</p><h2 id="oval-face">Lob for Oval Face Shape</h2><p>Lucky you! The oval face shape is the most versatile of all face shapes and can pull off just about any haircut. For an oval face shape, a lob with layers and texture will look great. The layers will add volume and movement to your hair, while the length will help elongate your face.</p><h2 id="round-face">Lob for Round Face Shape</h2><p>If you have a round face shape, you'll want to create the illusion of length to balance out your features. A lob with longer layers in the front and shorter layers in the back will help do just that. The longer layers will frame your face and draw the eye downward, while the shorter layers will add volume and movement to your hair.</p><h2 id="square-face">Lob for Square Face Shape</h2><p>A square face shape has strong, angular features, so you'll want to soften them with your lob. A layered lob with soft, wispy ends will help soften your jawline and cheekbones. Consider adding some side-swept bangs to create a more rounded shape.</p><h2 id="heart-face">Lob for Heart Face Shape</h2><p>For a heart face shape, you'll want to balance out your features by adding volume to the bottom half of your face. A lob with curls or waves will do just that. The curls will add volume and movement to your hair, while the length will help elongate your face.</p><h2 id="long-face">Lob for Long Face Shape</h2><p>If you have a long face shape, you'll want to create the illusion of width to balance out your features. A lob with blunt ends and a side part will help do just that. The blunt ends will add volume to the sides of your face, while the side part will help create the illusion of width.</p><h2 id="tips">Tips for Getting a Lob</h2><ul><li>Bring pictures to your stylist to show them exactly what you want.</li><li>Consider your lifestyle and how much time you're willing to spend styling your hair each day.</li><li>Ask your stylist for advice on which lob will best suit your face shape and hair type.</li><li>Be prepared for some upkeep - regular trims will keep your lob looking fresh.</li></ul><h2 id="faq">FAQs</h2><h3>Can anyone get a lob?</h3><p>Yes! The lob is a versatile haircut that can work for just about anyone.</p><h3>Do I need to have straight hair to get a lob?</h3><p>No, you don't! Lobs can work with curly, wavy, or straight hair.</p><h3>How often do I need to get my lob trimmed?</h3><p>It's recommended to get a trim every 6-8 weeks to keep your lob looking fresh.</p><h2 id="hair-care">Hair Care for Your Lob</h2><p>Now that you have your lob, it's important to take care of it to keep it looking its best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>Use a heat protectant before using any hot tools.</li><li>Avoid washing your hair every day - try to wash it every 2-3 days instead.</li><li>Invest in a good dry shampoo to keep your lob looking fresh in between washes.</li><li>Consider using a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and shiny.</li></ul><p>Now that you know which lob will suit your face shape, it's time to book that appointment with your stylist. Happy hairstyling!</p></article>
