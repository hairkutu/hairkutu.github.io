However, long shaggy hairstyles for round faces can be an excellent option to consider. In this article, we will explore how to achieve this hairstyle, tips to maintain it, and answer some of the frequently asked questions.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>Long shaggy hairstyles for round faces are a layered haircut that features a lot of texture and volume.

Use the tool to create loose waves or curls, or straighten your hair for a sleeker look.</p><h2>Tips to Maintain Long Shaggy Hairstyles for Round Faces</h2><p>To maintain long shaggy hairstyles for round faces, follow these tips:</p><ul><li>Use a dry shampoo to absorb excess oil and maintain the volume of your hair.</li><li>Trim your hair regularly to prevent split ends and maintain the shape of your haircut.</li><li>Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week to keep your hair healthy and moisturized.</li></ul><h2>FAQ – Long Shaggy Hairstyles for Round Faces</h2><h3>Q: Will long shaggy hairstyles for round faces suit me?</h3><p>A: Long shaggy hairstyles for round faces can suit anyone, regardless of their hair type, age, or face shape.
