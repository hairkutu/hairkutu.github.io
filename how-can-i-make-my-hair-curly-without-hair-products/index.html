Using hair products can be expensive, time-consuming, and damaging to your hair. However, there are natural ways to make your hair curly without using any hair products.

Braid Your Hair</h3><p>Braid your hair before going to bed and undo the braids in the morning. This will give you wavy hair, which can be easily turned into curls by twisting small sections of your hair.</p><h3>3. Use Rollers</h3><p>Use rollers to curl your hair. Simply roll small sections of your hair onto the rollers and leave them in place for a few hours or overnight. This will give you bouncy curls.</p><h3>4. Use a Curling Wand</h3><p>If you have a curling wand, you can use it to curl your hair. Simply wrap small sections of your hair around the wand and hold for a few seconds.
