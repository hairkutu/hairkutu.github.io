These products are specially formulated to add moisture and definition to your curls. After washing, gently towel dry your hair to remove excess water.</p><h2 id="step2">Step 2: Apply curl-enhancing products</h2><p>Next, apply a curl-enhancing product, such as a curl cream or mousse, to your damp hair. These products will help define your curls and keep them in place. Be sure to distribute the product evenly throughout your hair.</p><h2 id="step3">Step 3: Scrunch your hair</h2><p>Once your hair is coated in curl-enhancing product, use your hands to scrunch your hair. This will help enhance your curls and create that wet hair look. Continue to scrunch your hair until you have achieved the desired level of curliness.</p><h2 id="step4">Step 4: Let your hair air-dry</h2><p>Finally, let your hair air-dry. Avoid using a hairdryer, as this can disrupt your curls and make them frizzy. Instead, let your hair dry naturally, and don’t touch it until it’s completely dry.

If you have oily hair, you may need to wash it every day. If you have dry hair, you may only need to wash it once or twice a week. However, washing your hair too often can strip it of its natural oils, so it’s important to find a balance that works for you.</p><h3>Q: Can I get the wet hair look curly without using product?</h3><p>A: It’s possible, but using product can help enhance your curls and keep them in place.
