However, there are several ways to tame them and get the sleek and polished look you desire. In this article, we will provide you with a complete guide on how to tame the flyaways on top of your head. </p><h2> Table of Contents </h2><ul><li><a href="#how-to"> How to Tame the Flyaways on Top of Head </a></li><li><a href="#step-by-step"> Step by Step Guide </a></li><li><a href="#tips"> Tips for Managing Flyaways </a></li><li><a href="#faq"> Frequently Asked Questions </a></li><li><a href="#hair-care"> Hair Care Tips to Prevent Flyaways </a></li></ul><h2 id="how-to"> How to Tame the Flyaways on Top of Head </h2><p> The first step in taming the flyaways on the top of your head is to identify the cause. Flyaways can be caused by several factors, including dryness, static, and humidity. Once you know the cause, you can choose the appropriate solution. Here are some ways to tame the flyaways on top of your head: </p><h3> 1. Use a Hair Serum </h3><p> Hair serums are a great way to tame flyaways and add shine to your hair. Look for a serum that is lightweight and non-greasy. Apply a small amount to your fingertips and run them through your hair, focusing on the flyaways. Avoid applying too much serum, as it can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy. </p><h3> 2. Use a Hair Spray </h3><p> Hair spray is another effective way to tame flyaways. Look for a hairspray that is lightweight and provides a flexible hold. Hold the can about 8 inches away from your hair and spray lightly, focusing on the flyaways. Avoid using too much hairspray, as it can make your hair look stiff and crunchy. </p><h3> 3. Use a Toothbrush </h3><p> Believe it or not, a toothbrush can be a handy tool in taming flyaways. Spray a small amount of hairspray on a toothbrush and gently brush the flyaways down. This technique is especially useful for those with curly hair. </p><h3> 4. Use a Leave-In Conditioner </h3><p> Dryness can cause flyaways, so using a leave-in conditioner can help keep your hair moisturized and tame flyaways.
