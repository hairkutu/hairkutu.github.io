First, consider the texture of your hair. Wavy hair can range from loose waves to tight curls, so it's important to find a haircut that works with your natural texture. Second, think about your face shape. A shoulder length haircut can work for a variety of face shapes, but you want to make sure the cut flatters your features. Finally, consider your lifestyle and how much time you want to spend styling your hair.</p><p>Some popular haircuts for wavy hair shoulder length include:</p><h3>Long Bob (Lob)</h3><p>A long bob is a classic haircut that works well for wavy hair. The length hits just above the shoulders, and the ends are usually blunt or slightly layered. This cut is great for those who want a low-maintenance style that still looks chic and modern.</p><h3>Layered Shoulder Length</h3><p>A layered shoulder length cut is perfect for adding volume and movement to wavy hair. Layers can be cut throughout the length of the hair, or just at the ends to create a more textured look. This cut is great for those who want a versatile style that can be worn straight or wavy.</p><h3>Side-Swept Bangs</h3><p>Side-swept bangs can add a touch of glamour to a shoulder length haircut for wavy hair. The bangs can be cut at different lengths, depending on how much hair you want to cover.
