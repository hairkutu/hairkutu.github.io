Maybe you're tired of spending money at the barbershop, or maybe you just want to learn a new skill. Either way, cutting hair can be a daunting task, but with the right tools and techniques, anyone can do it.</p><p>In this article, we'll provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to cut the back and sides of men's hair.

You will need a pair of hair clippers, hair scissors, a comb, and a spray bottle filled with water. You may also want to use a cape or towel to keep the hair off the client's clothes.</p><p>When cutting the back and sides of a man's hair, it's important to use the right technique. Start by using the clippers to create a guide for the length of the hair. You can do this by using a higher guard for longer hair or a lower guard for shorter hair. Make sure to use smooth, even strokes to avoid creating uneven patches.</p><p>Next, use the scissors to trim the hair around the ears and the nape of the neck. Make sure to use the comb to lift the hair and cut it in a straight line. This will create a clean, polished look.</p><p>Repeat this process on both sides of the head, making sure to keep the length consistent. Once you've finished cutting the back and sides, you can move on to the top of the head.</p><h3 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Guide</h3><p>Here's a step-by-step guide on how to cut the back and sides of men's hair:</p><ol><li>Start by wetting the hair with the spray bottle.
