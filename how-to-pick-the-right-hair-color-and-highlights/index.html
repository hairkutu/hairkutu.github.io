This will help you determine which hair colors and highlights will complement your natural features the best. Here are some tips:</p><ul><li>If you have warm undertones (yellow or golden), opt for warm hair colors such as golden blonde or auburn.</li><li>If you have cool undertones (pink or blue), choose cool hair colors such as ash blonde or black.</li><li>If you have a neutral undertone, you can pull off both warm and cool hair colors.</li><li>Consider your eye color as well.

Here are some things to keep in mind:</p><ul><li>If you want a natural look, opt for hair colors that are close to your natural shade. You can add subtle highlights for dimension.</li><li>If you want something bold, consider bright colors such as red or purple. You can also opt for dramatic highlights such as blonde or platinum.</li><li>If you want something low-maintenance, choose a hair color that is close to your natural shade. This will make regrowth less noticeable.</li><li>If you don't mind regular touch-ups, choose a hair color that is drastically different from your natural shade.
