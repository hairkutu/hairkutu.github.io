The bleach can strip your hair of its natural oils, leaving it dry, brittle, and prone to breakage. If you've bleached your hair and are now dealing with the aftermath, don't worry. With the right care and attention, you can repair your hair and bring it back to life.</p><h2 id="how-to">How to Repair Damaged Hair from Bleach</h2><p>The first step in repairing damaged hair from bleach is to cut off the damaged hair. This may sound extreme, but it's necessary to prevent further damage. Once you've cut off the damaged hair, you can start to focus on repairing the hair that's left. Here are some tips:</p><h3>1. Use a Deep Conditioner</h3><p>Deep conditioning treatments are essential for repairing damaged hair from bleach. Look for a conditioner that contains ingredients like keratin, amino acids, and proteins, which will help to rebuild and strengthen your hair. Leave the conditioner on for at least 30 minutes, or overnight if possible.</p><h3>2. Use a Protein Treatment</h3><p>Protein treatments are another great way to repair damaged hair from bleach. These treatments penetrate the hair shaft and help to rebuild the hair from the inside out. Look for a protein treatment that contains hydrolyzed keratin or collagen.</p><h3>3. Avoid Heat Styling</h3><p>Heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons can further damage already weakened hair. Try to avoid heat styling as much as possible, or use a heat protectant spray if you must use heat styling tools.</p><h3>4. Use a Leave-In Conditioner</h3><p>A leave-in conditioner can help to protect your hair from further damage. Look for a conditioner that contains ingredients like shea butter or coconut oil, which will help to moisturize and strengthen your hair.</p><h3>5. Be Gentle When Brushing</h3><p>When your hair is damaged, it's more prone to breakage. Be gentle when brushing your hair, and use a wide-tooth comb or a brush with soft bristles.
