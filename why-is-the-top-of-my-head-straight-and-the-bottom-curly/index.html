This is a common question that many people ask themselves. The answer lies in the structure of your hair and the way it grows. In this article, we will explore why the top of your head is straight and the bottom is curly, and provide tips on how to care for your hair.</p><h2>Description</h2><p>The hair on the top of your head is straight because it grows out of the hair follicles at a more perpendicular angle to your scalp. This causes the hair to grow straighter and more uniform. The hair on the bottom of your head, however, grows at a more oblique angle, causing it to curl or wave. This is due to the shape of the hair follicles and the way they are oriented in the scalp.</p><h2>How to Determine Hair Type</h2><p>Before you can properly care for your hair, it is important to determine your hair type. There are three main types of hair: straight, wavy, and curly. Straight hair is characterized by a smooth, shiny texture and a lack of curl or wave. Wavy hair has a slight curl or wave to it, while curly hair is tightly coiled.</p><p>You can determine your hair type by examining the shape of your hair follicles. Straight hair follicles are round, while wavy and curly hair follicles are more oval or elliptical in shape. You can also determine your hair type by observing the way your hair behaves when wet. Straight hair will remain straight, while wavy and curly hair will become more curly or wavy.</p><h2>Step by Step Guide to Care for Your Hair</h2><p>1. Determine your hair type<br/> 2. Use a shampoo and conditioner that is formulated for your hair type<br/> 3. Avoid using hot tools such as straighteners or curling irons<br/> 4. Use a wide-toothed comb to detangle your hair<br/> 5. Use a leave-in conditioner to help prevent breakage and promote healthy hair<br/> 6. Avoid using harsh chemicals such as bleach or relaxers<br/> 7. Use a heat protectant spray if you must use hot tools<br/> 8. Get regular trims to prevent split ends and promote healthy hair growth<br/> 9. Protect your hair from the sun and other environmental factors<br/> 10. Eat a healthy diet that is rich in vitamins and minerals that promote healthy hair growth</p><h2>Tips for Maintaining Healthy Hair</h2><p>1. Avoid washing your hair every day<br/> 2. Use a deep conditioning treatment once a week<br/> 3. Avoid brushing your hair when wet<br/> 4. Do not rub your hair vigorously with a towel when drying it<br/> 5. Use a silk or satin pillowcase to prevent breakage<br/> 6. Protect your hair when swimming by wearing a swim cap or applying a leave-in conditioner<br/> 7. Use a clarifying shampoo once a month to remove buildup<br/> 8. Avoid using hair ties that are too tight as they can cause breakage<br/> 9. Use a boar bristle brush to distribute natural oils throughout your hair<br/> 10. Be gentle when handling your hair to prevent breakage</p><h2>FAQs</h2><h3>Why is the top of my head straight and the bottom curly?</h3><p>The hair on the top of your head is straight because it grows out of the hair follicles at a more perpendicular angle to your scalp.
